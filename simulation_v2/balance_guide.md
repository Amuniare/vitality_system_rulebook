# Enhancement Balance Analysis Guide v2.1
## Production Edition with Critical Report Assessment

**Purpose:** Systematic framework for analyzing saturation heatmaps and recommending balance changes for any TTRPG enhancement system.

**Target Goal:** Move all enhancements toward **medium saturation (1-6%)** across all performance tiers while maintaining meaningful choices.

---

## Report Priority & Usage

### ü•á Essential Report: Saturation Heatmap (REQUIRED)

**File:** `{archetype}_saturation_summary_heatmap.md`

**Why it's essential:**
- **Balance IS saturation** - you're trying to get enhancements into 1-6% range
- Shows pattern types at a glance (Top-Heavy, Universal Appeal, Inverted)
- Contains all 6 saturation data points (Top 10, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000)
- Includes distribution statistics (High/Medium/Low counts)
- Single source of truth for identifying balance problems

**What I can diagnose from just the heatmap:**
- Which enhancements need nerfs/buffs (saturation too high/low)
- Pattern classification (Top-Heavy vs Universal vs Inverted)
- Priority ranking (üî¥üü†üü°üü¢‚ùå)
- Whether to adjust price or bonus/penalty
- Price tier distribution (count enhancements at each cost)

**90% of balance decisions can be made from the heatmap alone.**

---

### ü•à Optional Report: Enhancement Ranking (HELPFUL CONTEXT)

**File:** `enhancement_ranking_{archetype}.md`

**Why it's optional:**
- Adds performance context to popularity data
- Helps catch noob traps (popular but bad)
- Identifies hidden gems (unpopular but good)
- Shows attack type compatibility

**When to include this report:**
- Investigating why an enhancement has weird saturation
- Need to verify if high saturation = high performance
- Want to understand dual_natured combat behavior
- Cross-referencing edge cases

**What's useful from ranking report:**
- **Avg Turns** - overall performance baseline
- **Top20% vs Med** - performance in good builds
- **Med Rank** - where builds with this typically rank
- **Attack Type Breakdown** - compatibility check

**What's overkill from ranking report:**
- Top0.02% through Top5% metrics (too granular)
- Slot1/Slot2, Used1/Used2 (interesting but not actionable)

---

### ‚ùå Skip This Report: Cost Analysis (REDUNDANT)

**File:** `cost_analysis_{archetype}.md`

**Why to skip it:**
- Just the Ranking Report reorganized by cost
- Same columns, same data, different sort order
- Cost is already visible in both other reports
- No unique insights or new information
- "Cost distribution" is trivial (just counts)

**Everything useful in Cost Analysis can be derived from the Heatmap:**
- Count enhancements at each price tier manually
- Compare options within a price tier by scanning
- Check price distribution health from heatmap

---

## Updated Saturation Thresholds

**Recommended Thresholds:**
- **Low:** <1% (truly dead/unused content)
- **Medium:** 1-6% (target range, healthy balance)
- **High:** >6% (too popular, needs rebalancing)

**Target Distribution Goals:**
- Low (<1%): < 10% of enhancements
- Medium (1-6%): > 50% of enhancements
- High (>6%): < 40% of enhancements

**What Saturation Means:**
- 1% = 1-in-100 builds (niche)
- 3% = 1-in-33 builds (healthy option)
- 6% = 1-in-17 builds (popular, threshold for concern)
- 10% = 1-in-10 builds (very popular, needs nerf)
- 20% = 1-in-5 builds (dominant, critical priority)

---

## Available Balance Levers

### Price (Both Upgrades & Limits)
- **Range:** 1p, 2p, or 3p only
- **Goal:** Somewhat even distribution across all three price tiers
- **Sensitivity:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL** - Changing by 1p can move an enhancement from top to bottom or vice versa

**Price Distribution Tracking:**
```
Target Distribution:
- 1p enhancements: ~33% of total
- 2p enhancements: ~33% of total  
- 3p enhancements: ~33% of total

Check after each change:
- Count enhancements at each price tier (from heatmap)
- Flag if any tier has >40% or <25% of total
```

---

### Limits: Tier Bonus Multiplier
- **Preferred Range:** 1√óTier to 4√óTier
- **Maximum:** 6√óTier (use only for extremely restrictive limits)
- **Increments:** ¬±0.5√óTier or ¬±1√óTier
- **Sensitivity:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL** - Changing by 1√óTier can completely flip saturation

**Common Tier Bonus Values:**
```
+1√óTier  = Mild bonus (for lenient limits)
+2√óTier  = Standard bonus (most common)
+3√óTier  = Strong bonus (restrictive limits)
+4√óTier  = Very strong bonus (very restrictive limits)
+5√óTier  = Extreme bonus (rarely used)
+6√óTier  = Maximum bonus (only for near-impossible conditions)
```

---

### Upgrades: Penalties & Effects

**Accuracy Penalties (in order of severity):**
```
Tier 0: No penalty
Tier 1: -1 flat to accuracy
Tier 2: -2 flat to accuracy
Tier 3: -3 flat to accuracy
Tier 4: -Tier to accuracy
Tier 5: -Tier to accuracy and damage
Tier 6: -2√óTier to accuracy and damage
```

**Damage Penalties (common patterns):**
```
-1 flat to damage
-2 flat to damage
-3 flat to damage
-Tier to damage
-2√óTier to damage
```

**Effect Adjustments:**
- Chain limits (max chains: Tier/2, Tier/3, Tier/4)
- Duration changes (1 turn, 2 turns, 3 turns)
- Trigger conditions (tighten or loosen requirements)
- Cooldown durations (2 turns, 3 turns, 4 turns)

---

### Banning Specific Combinations

**When to use:**
- A single enhancement is balanced across most builds
- But becomes dominant when combined with specific enhancement(s)
- Nerfing either enhancement individually would make them too weak

**Format:**
```
BAN: [enhancement_A] + [enhancement_B]
Reason: [Specific synergy that breaks balance]
Alternative: Allow A or B individually, just not together
```

---

## Reading Saturation Patterns

### Pattern Types

| Pattern Name | Example Curve | What It Means | Typical Fix |
|--------------|---------------|---------------|-------------|
| **Top-Heavy Exploit** | 50% ‚Üí 20% ‚Üí 5% ‚Üí 2% | Optimized by skilled builders, ignored by others | **Reduce Bonus** |
| **Universal Appeal** | 25% ‚Üí 23% ‚Üí 20% ‚Üí 18% | Everyone wants it at all skill levels | **Increase Price** |
| **Inverted Curve** | 5% ‚Üí 10% ‚Üí 15% ‚Üí 20% | Weaker builds over-rely on it | **Reduce Bonus or Increase Price** |
| **Dead Enhancement** | 0% ‚Üí 0% ‚Üí 1% ‚Üí 2% | Nobody uses it | **Buff (reduce price or increase bonus)** |
| **Volatile Spike** | 5% ‚Üí 30% ‚Üí 8% ‚Üí 5% | Powerful in specific niche | **Add restrictions or increase cost** |
| **Already Balanced** | 4% ‚Üí 5% ‚Üí 6% ‚Üí 5% | Flat curve in target range | **No change needed** |

---

## Diagnostic Framework

### Step 1: Calculate Pattern Metrics

For each enhancement, calculate:

```
Drop Severity = (Top 10 saturation - Top 1000 saturation) / Top 10 saturation

Flatness Score = Standard deviation of all saturation values

Average Saturation = Mean across all Top N tiers

Price Tier Balance = Count(enhancements at this price) / Total enhancements
```

**Thresholds:**
- **Drop Severity > 0.6** = Top-Heavy Exploit
- **Flatness Score < 3** = Universal Appeal  
- **Inverted** = Top 1000 > Top 10
- **Dead** = Average Saturation < 1%
- **Volatile** = Large spikes in middle tiers

---

### Step 2: Identify Root Cause & Select Appropriate Lever

#### For High Saturation (>6% average):

**Q1: Is the curve flat or steep?**
- **Flat (stays 15-20% across tiers)** ‚Üí Universal Appeal
  - ‚úÖ **Increase Price** (1p‚Üí2p or 2p‚Üí3p)
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Check if target price tier is crowded
  
- **Steep (drops from 30%‚Üí5%)** ‚Üí Top-Heavy Exploit
  - For **Limits**: **Reduce Tier Bonus** by 0.5√óTier or 1√óTier
  - For **Upgrades**: **Increase Penalty** by one tier on the scale
  - Alternative: Check if it's only strong with specific combos ‚Üí **Ban combination**

**Q2: Is it a specific combination problem?**
- Does saturation spike only when paired with specific enhancement(s)?
  - ‚úÖ **Ban the combination** instead of nerfing individual pieces
  - Check pairing data if available

**Q3: Will price change help or hurt price distribution?**
- Check current distribution at target price tier
  - If target tier already has >40% of enhancements ‚Üí **Use bonus/penalty adjustment instead**
  - If target tier has <30% of enhancements ‚Üí **Price change is safe**

---

#### For Low Saturation (<1% average):

**Q4: Is the cost too high for the benefit?**
- **Yes** (high cost, weak effect)
  - For **Limits**: Increase tier bonus by 0.5√óTier or 1√óTier
  - For **Upgrades**: Reduce penalty by one tier
  - Alternative: **Reduce Price** (3p‚Üí2p or 2p‚Üí1p) if price tier allows
  
**Q5: Does it have overly severe restrictions?**
- **Yes** ‚Üí Can't reduce restrictions without redesign
  - For **Limits**: Increase tier bonus compensation
  - For **Upgrades**: Reduce penalty or add secondary benefit

**Q6: Will price change create distribution problems?**
- Lowering price might overcrowd the 1p tier
  - If 1p already has >40% of enhancements ‚Üí **Buff bonus/reduce penalty instead**

---

### Step 3: Sensitivity Check

**Before recommending changes:**

‚ö†Ô∏è **Small changes have MASSIVE effects**

**For Limits (Tier Bonus):**
- Changing +3√óTier ‚Üí +2√óTier can move saturation from 20% ‚Üí 5%
- Changing +2√óTier ‚Üí +3√óTier can move saturation from 5% ‚Üí 20%
- **Default recommendation:** ¬±1√óTier adjustments only
- **Extreme cases only:** ¬±2√óTier adjustments

**For Upgrades (Penalties):**
- Moving from "no penalty" to "-1 flat" can halve saturation
- Moving from "-Tier" to "-Tier acc/dmg" can move saturation from 15% ‚Üí 3%
- **Default recommendation:** One tier shift on penalty scale
- **Extreme cases only:** Two tier shifts

**For Price:**
- 1p ‚Üí 2p can move saturation from 25% ‚Üí 8%
- 2p ‚Üí 1p can move saturation from 3% ‚Üí 15%
- **Always check:** Price tier distribution before recommending

## Priority Ranking System

### üî¥ Critical Priority (Fix Immediately)

**Criteria:**
- Top 10 saturation > 20% AND drops to < 5% in Top 1000
- Average saturation > 15%
- Drop Severity > 0.7

**Recommended Approach:**
- Use conservative fixes (1√óTier or one penalty tier)
- Avoid price changes if price tier would become crowded
- Consider combination bans if pattern suggests synergy abuse

---

### üü† High Priority (Fix Soon)

**Criteria:**
- Flat curve with average saturation 8-15%
- Top 10 saturation 15-20% with moderate drop-off
- Flatness Score < 3

**Recommended Approach:**
- Price changes preferred (if tier distribution allows)
- Otherwise use bonus/penalty adjustments
- Monitor for cascade effects after changes

---

### üü° Medium Priority (Monitor and Adjust)

**Criteria:**
- Inverted patterns (Top 1000 > Top 10)
- Average saturation 6-8% but uneven
- Volatile spikes

**Recommended Approach:**
- Conservative adjustments (0.5√óTier or partial penalty tier)
- May resolve naturally after higher priority fixes
- Watch for pattern changes

---

### üü¢ Low Priority (Nice to Fix)

**Criteria:**
- Average saturation 1-2% or 7-8%
- Minor optimization exploits
- Close to target but slightly off

**Recommended Approach:**
- Smallest possible adjustments
- May not need fixing if price distribution is healthy
- Address only after all higher priorities resolved

---

### ‚ùå Buff Required (Dead Content)

**Criteria:**
- Average saturation < 1%
- Never appears in Top 50
- Completely unused

**Recommended Approach:**
- Start with 0.5√óTier or one penalty tier reduction
- Test before further buffs
- High risk of over-correction

### Template 5: Combination Ban

```
Problematic Combination Detected

Enhancement A: [NAME_A] ([COST]p, [SPECS])
Enhancement B: [NAME_B] ([COST]p, [SPECS])

Issue:
- Individual saturations: A=[X]%, B=[Y]%  
- When paired together: [Z]% (or anecdotally dominant)
- Synergy: [EXPLAIN MECHANICAL INTERACTION]

Recommended Fix:
BAN COMBINATION: [NAME_A] + [NAME_B]
- Keep both enhancements unchanged individually
- Prevent selection of both in same build

Alternative Fix (if ban system not available):

## Testing Protocol

### Phase 1: Critical Fixes Only (Conservative)
1. Implement üî¥ Critical Priority changes
2. **Use minimum adjustments:** 1√óTier or one penalty tier
3. Run simulation with standard settings
4. Generate new heatmap
5. **Check for overcorrection** (did 20%‚Üí5% become 5%‚Üí20%?)
6. Document actual vs expected outcomes

### Phase 2: Adjust Overcorrections
1. Identify any overcorrections from Phase 1
2. **Reverse half the change** (if went too far)
3. Run simulation again
4. Verify corrections

### Phase 3: High Priority Fixes
1. Implement üü† High Priority changes
2. **Check price tier distribution** after each change
3. Run simulation
4. Verify cascade effects (did fixing X affect Y?)

### Phase 4: Medium/Low Priority & Buffs
1. Implement remaining changes
2. Run final simulation
3. Calculate system-wide metrics
4. Document final price tier distribution

---

## System Health Metrics

Track these after each balance pass:

```
1. Overall Balance Score:
   = (Count of Medium 1-6% enhancements) / (Total enhancements)
   Target: > 0.60

2. Price Tier Distribution:
   1p: [PERCENT]% (target: 25-40%)
   2p: [PERCENT]% (target: 25-40%)
   3p: [PERCENT]% (target: 25-40%)

3. Average Saturation Variance:
   = Std Dev of all average saturations
   Target: < 5.0

4. Top-Heavy Ratio:
   = (Avg Top 10 saturation) / (Avg Top 1000 saturation)
   Target: 0.8 - 1.2

5. Dead Enhancement Count:
   = Count of enhancements < 1% average saturation
   Target: < 10% of total

6. Dominant Enhancement Count:
   = Count of enhancements > 15% average saturation
   Target: 0

## Quick Reference: What Data Answers What Question

| Question | Best Report | Why |
|----------|-------------|-----|
| Which enhancements need nerfs/buffs? | **Heatmap** | Shows saturation directly |
