## Notes

- **Avg Turns**: Average across all compatible attack types and scenarios
- **Attack Type Columns**: Average turns for that specific attack type
- **0.0**: Enhancement not compatible with that attack type
- **100.0**: Attack type exists but wasn't tested for this enhancement
- **Isolation Testing**: Each enhancement tested alone (baseline + enhancement only)
- **Cost Efficiency**: Lower cost + lower turns = better value
