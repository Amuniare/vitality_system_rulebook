## Notes

- **Avg Turns**: Average across all compatible attack types and scenarios
- **Attack Type Columns**: Average turns for that specific attack type (0 = not compatible)
- **Testing Method**: Each enhancement tested with baseline attack + prerequisites (if any)
- **Isolation Testing**: Shows raw enhancement power without synergies
- **Compare to Build Rankings**: Build rankings show enhancements in combination, not isolation
