- need avg turns column for enhancement_ranking_report generation in reporting.py, and rank is based on avg turns
- need build_turns_table when generating in reporting.py to sort by avg turns.
- need a 2 columns added to enhancement_ranking_report generation in reporting.py and the first median is of of the top 10% of builds, 2nd is the median of the top 50% of builds
- need 5 columns added to enhancement_ranking_report generation in reporting.py, which gives avg turns per attack type
- need new table to generate in reporting.py called enhancement_comparrison which compares the avg turns of a upgrade/limit (rows), and then 6 columns(avg of all 5 attack types, and the 5 attack types), the values are the avg turns for enhancements in a build - avg turns for enhancements in a individual.
