Review the following key documents:

modernApp\app.js

modernApp\README.md
modernApp\requirements.md
modernApp\workplan.md
console.txt
3 attached screenshots


Your job is to fix this ModernApp, to work how it is intended to work, as laid out in Architecture.md


We'll be doing a review of the app, the images and the console log
1. does this abide by architexture.md, requirements.md and README.md
2. does this make appropriate and effective use of components, core, systems, data and utils files
3. review the attached screenshots and console.txt, what issues can you see
4. what would you recommend working on next


## Chain-of-Thought 
Analyze this code problem using these steps:
	1. Identify the core requirements
	2. Break down the technical constraints
	3. Consider potential edge cases
	4. Develop an algorithm addressing all constraints
	5. Evaluate time and space complexity
	6. Propose implementation approaches

Your job is to fix this ModernApp, to work how it is intended to work, as laid out in Architecture.md and ensure that you make appropriate and effective use of components, core, systems, data and utils files


We'll be working on:


explaining why the errors are happening in the console log
identifying root cause
finding and proposing solutions that align with our goals of making appropriate and effective use of components, core, systems, data and utils files

	3. Consider potential edge cases
	4. Develop an algorithm addressing all constraints
	5. Evaluate time and space complexity
	6. Propose implementation approaches


Don't Write Code, just identify problems and root cause of issues, and explain simply any potential solutions

Your job is to fix this ModernApp, to work how it is intended to work, as laid out in Architecture.md and ensure that you make appropriate and effective use of components, core, systems, data and utils files


We'll be working on:

Creating a document, which:
- identifies identifying root cause of issues, and 
- find solutions that align with our goals of making appropriate and effective use of components, core, systems, data and utils files, 
- serve as a roadmap / implementation plan to address all issues


Issues:
- All issues that you see in the log
- clicking the tabs, doesn't do anything and does even change anything in the log
- tab-navigation buttons are visible, but don't work
