# P1 Testing Implementation Roadmap

## Overview
This document provides a detailed roadmap for implementing P1 testing coverage to ensure AI can complete the entire character creation process without logical errors.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Testing Infrastructure
- **Python Testing**: Limited (`src/transcriber/test_ai_processing.py` only)
- **Playwright Configuration**: Available in `/simulation/` with basic setup
- **AI Testing Framework**: Partial implementation in `/simulation/tools/Brain.js`
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive testing plans in `frontend/docs/specs_and_notes/`

### Testing Gaps Identified
1. **No Frontend Testing**: Character builder web application lacks automated tests
2. **No Complete Workflow Testing**: No end-to-end character creation validation
3. **No Unit Tests**: Core business logic systems untested
4. **No Integration Tests**: Cross-component interactions unvalidated
5. **No CI/CD Integration**: Testing not part of development workflow

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup (Priority: Critical)

#### 1.1 Test Directory Structure Creation
Create comprehensive test infrastructure following documented architecture:

```

#### 1.2 Dependencies Installation
Required npm packages for testing framework:
- `@playwright/test`: Browser automation
- `@google/generative-ai`: AI decision making
- `jest`: Unit testing framework
- `jest-environment-jsdom`: DOM simulation for unit tests

#### 1.3 Configuration Files Setup
- **playwright.config.js**: Configure for character builder testing with extended timeout
- **package.json**: Test scripts and dependencies
- **.gitignore**: Exclude test artifacts and node_modules

### Phase 2: AI Testing Framework Implementation (Priority: High)

#### 2.1 Actor.js - Human-like Page Interactions
Implement robust page interaction library with:
- Randomized delays to prevent race conditions
- Element visibility and enablement checks
- Comprehensive logging of all actions
- Error handling and retry mechanisms

**Key Methods:**
- `async click(selector, description)`
- `async type(selector, text, description)`
- `async select(selector, value, description)`
- `async navigateToTab(tabName)`
- `async getVisibleOptions(selector)`

#### 2.2 Brain.js - AI Decision Engine
Enhance existing `/simulation/tools/Brain.js` with:
- Rule-aware character build strategy generation
- Context-sensitive decision making for each tab
- Validation of AI responses against game rules
- Retry logic for API failures

**Core Decision Methods:**
- `async generateBuildConcept()`
- `async chooseArchetype(buildConcept, availableOptions)`
- `async distributeAttributes(buildConcept, characterState)`
- `async chooseMainPoolItems(buildConcept, availableItems)`
- `async designSpecialAttack(buildConcept, characterState)`

#### 2.3 Journey.js - Test Orchestration
Manage complete character creation workflow:
- State tracking throughout character creation
- Detailed logging of every decision and action
- Final validation against summary tab
- Success/failure determination and reporting

#### 2.4 RulebookParser.js - Rule Integration
Parse and structure `frontend/rules/rulebook.md` for AI consumption:
- Extract game mechanics and rules
- Provide contextual rule sections to AI
- Enable rule-compliant character generation

### Phase 3: Core Test Implementation (Priority: High)

#### 3.1 AI Prompt Templates
Create sophisticated prompts for each decision point:
- Build concept generation with thematic consistency
- Archetype selection based on character goals
- Attribute distribution following build strategy

#### 3.2 Main Test Suite
Implement `ai-character-creator.spec.js`:
- Loop for 100 AI-driven character creations
- Clean state initialization for each run
- Comprehensive error handling and reporting
- Performance monitoring and timeout management

#### 3.3 Validation Framework
End-to-end validation system:

- Point pool calculation verification
- Summary tab data accuracy validation
- Export functionality testing

### Phase 4: Extended Testing Coverage (Priority: Medium)

#### 4.1 Unit Testing Implementation
Core component testing with Jest:
- System classes (UtilitySystem, UniqueAbilitySystem, etc.)
- Calculator functions (PointPoolCalculator, StatCalculator)
- Data management (GameDataManager, VitalityCharacter)
- Validation logic and error handling

#### 4.2 Integration Testing
Cross-component interaction validation:
- Tab state synchronization
- Character update propagation
- Event system integrity
- Data flow validation

#### 4.3 Specialized Scenarios
