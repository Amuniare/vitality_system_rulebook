# Phase 16: Custom Feature Implementation

## Objective
To allow users to create their own custom utility abilities (Features, Senses, etc.) directly from the UI.

## Outcome
-   Created a reusable CustomUtilityForm.js component.
-   Added logic to UtilityTab.js to display a "Create Custom" card in each generic utility section.
-   Implemented purchaseCustomItem and alidateCustomItemPurchase in UtilitySystem.js to handle the creation and data validation of these user-generated items.
-   **Result:** Users now have greater flexibility and can create their own content within the app.
