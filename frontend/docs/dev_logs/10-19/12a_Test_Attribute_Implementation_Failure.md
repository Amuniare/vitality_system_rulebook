# Phase 12-A (Test): Attribute Implementation Failure

## Objective
An internal test to add data-testid attributes to the Attribute tab's input fields to facilitate E2E testing.

## Outcome
-   The initial implementation was incorrect, as it added data-testid to a span instead of an input.
-   The test failed because Playwright could not ill() a non-input element.
-   **Result:** This failure highlighted the need to refactor the attribute controls to use actual <input type='number'> elements for testability, which was implemented in a later phase.
