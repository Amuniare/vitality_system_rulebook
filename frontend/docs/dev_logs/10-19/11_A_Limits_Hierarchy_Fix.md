# Phase 11-A: Limits Hierarchy Fix

## Objective
To resolve a bug where the UI for Special Attack Limits was not correctly representing the parent-child relationship between limit types, variants, and modifiers.

## Outcome
-   Modified the LimitSelection.js component to render limits in a nested, hierarchical structure.
-   Updated the UI to visually indent variants and modifiers under their parent limits.
-   **Result:** The UI now accurately reflects the game's rules for limit dependencies.
