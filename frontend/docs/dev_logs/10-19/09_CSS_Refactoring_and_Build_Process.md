# Phase 09: CSS Refactoring and Build Process

## Objective
To improve CSS maintainability by refactoring stylesheets into a modular, partials-based system and creating a build script to concatenate them into a single file for production. This addresses performance issues caused by multiple @import statements.

## Outcome
-   Created a structured CSS directory with ase, components, and 	abs subfolders.
-   Refactored all existing styles into modular _partial.css files.
-   Developed a PowerShell script (	ools/build-css.ps1) to concatenate partials into character-builder.css.
-   **Result:** Significantly improved page load times and developer organization.
