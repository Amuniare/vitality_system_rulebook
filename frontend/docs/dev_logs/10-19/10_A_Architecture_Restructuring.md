# Phase 10-A: Application Architecture Restructuring

## Objective
To implement a more robust and scalable architecture by separating concerns into distinct layers: pp, eatures, systems, calculators, core, and shared. This was a proactive measure to manage growing complexity.

## Outcome
-   Code was reorganized into the new directory structure.
-   Established the core principle of a one-way data flow (UI -> System -> Update -> Re-render).
-   **Result:** A much cleaner, more maintainable codebase, though it introduced temporary breakage in import paths.
