# Phase 12-C: Fixing Unique Abilities

## Objective
To fix a core logic bug where purchasing a unique ability with upgrades was failing silently or not calculating the total cost correctly.

## Outcome
-   Debugged the purchaseUniqueAbility method in UniqueAbilitySystem.js.
-   Ensured the total cost calculated in the UI matches the cost processed by the system.
-   Fixed the character data model to correctly store the purchased ability along with its selected upgrades.
-   **Result:** The Unique Ability purchase workflow is now fully functional and reliable.
