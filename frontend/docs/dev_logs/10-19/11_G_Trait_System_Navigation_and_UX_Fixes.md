# Phase 11-G: Trait System Navigation and UX Fixes

## Objective
To fix usability issues in the Trait creation system, particularly with the multi-step selection process for stats and conditions.

## Outcome
-   Reworked the TraitPurchaseSection.js component.
-   Disabled the "Purchase Trait" button until all conditions are met (2 stats, 1+ condition).
-   Improved the display of selected stats and the running total of condition tier points.
-   **Result:** The trait creation process is less error-prone and more intuitive for the user.
