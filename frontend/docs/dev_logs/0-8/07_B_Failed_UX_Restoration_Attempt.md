# Phase 7: Failed UX Restoration Attempt *(December 7, 2025)*
**Problem**: User reported complete UX regression - attack/effect type selection broken, limit selection worse than before
- Attack/effect type dropdowns not working
- Limit cards not clickable despite modal removal
- Overall functionality worse than previous implementation

**Attempted Solutions**:
- âŒ Added missing AttackTypeSystem methods (getAttackTypeDefinitions, getEffectTypeDefinitions, getBasicConditions)
- âŒ Redesigned LimitSelection to remove modal approach and show limits inline
- âŒ Enhanced AttackBasicsForm with selected type tags and conditional fields
- âŒ Improved visual feedback and information architecture

**Result**: Complete failure - "didn't fix anything, it literally didn't work at all"

**Critical Analysis**:
- **Root Cause Unknown**: Event handlers match, methods exist, but functionality still broken
- **Data Loading Issues**: Likely problems with GameDataManager or JSON data structure
- **Component Integration**: Possible timing or lifecycle issues between components
- **Regression Severity**: User experience significantly worse than baseline

**Key Lessons**:
- **Never assume incremental fixes work** - always verify basic functionality first
- **UX regression is unacceptable** - better to revert to working version
- **Component refactoring is risky** - original modal approach may have been functionally superior
- **User feedback is critical** - technical implementation means nothing if UX fails

**Next Actions Needed**:
1. **Emergency revert** to last known working version
2. **Comprehensive debugging** of data flow and method calls
3. **Console error analysis** to identify JavaScript failures
4. **Step-by-step verification** of each interaction before making changes
