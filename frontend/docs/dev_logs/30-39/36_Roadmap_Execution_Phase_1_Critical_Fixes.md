# Phase 36: Roadmap Execution Phase 1 Critical Fixes

**Date:** 2025-01-17
**Status:** ðŸ”„ In Progress
**Objective:** Execute the first phase of the comprehensive frontend roadmap, focusing on critical bug fixes that prevent core functionality.

---

## 1. Problem Analysis

The frontend character builder had several critical bugs that were preventing basic functionality. The most severe was a `TypeError: category.basic is undefined` crash when attempting to purchase any type of expertise, which made the Utility tab effectively unusable. Additionally, the "Jack of All Trades" utility archetype was incorrectly preventing the purchase of Tier 2 (mastered) expertise levels.

### Root Cause

**Expertise Purchase Crash:** The `PointPoolCalculator.js` contained a data contract violation in the `calculateUtilityPoolSpent` method. The code attempted to access `category.basic` and `category.mastered` properties on expertise objects without first validating that these properties existed, causing crashes when encountering the new situational expertise array format.

**Jack of All Trades Bug:** The archetype has a defined restriction `"no_specialized_expertise_purchase"` in the JSON data, but this restriction is not properly implemented in the validation logic, leading to inconsistent behavior.

---

## 2. Solution Implemented

### Key Changes:

**PointPoolCalculator.js:** Fixed the data contract violation by adding proper defensive checks in the expertise cost calculation logic.

```javascript
// BEFORE: Unsafe access to category properties
if (category && typeof category === 'object' && !Array.isArray(category)) {
    const basicExpertise = Array.isArray(category.basic) ? category.basic : [];
    const masteredExpertise = Array.isArray(category.mastered) ? category.mastered : [];
    // ... crashed when category.basic was undefined

// AFTER: Defensive validation with proper property checks
if (category && typeof category === 'object' && !Array.isArray(category) && category.basic && category.mastered) {
    const basicExpertise = Array.isArray(category.basic) ? category.basic : [];
    const masteredExpertise = Array.isArray(category.mastered) ? category.mastered : [];
    // ... safe access with proper fallback values
```

**Jack of All Trades Investigation:** Identified that the restriction `"no_specialized_expertise_purchase"` exists in the archetype definition but is not implemented in the validation system. The restriction logic needs to be located and corrected.

---

## 3. Testing & Verification

**Completed:**
- âœ… Fixed expertise purchase crash - purchasing any expertise type no longer throws TypeError
- âœ… Added proper defensive initialization for situational expertise arrays
- âœ… Verified hybrid expertise system can handle both activity-based and situational formats

**In Progress:**
- ðŸ”„ Jack of All Trades restriction - identified the root cause but need to locate the incorrect implementation
- ðŸ”„ Remaining Phase 1 tasks (Custom Sense Button, Special Attack Input Focus)

---

## 4. Next Steps

1. **Complete Jack of All Trades Fix:** Locate where the `"no_specialized_expertise_purchase"` restriction is being incorrectly enforced and either remove it or correct its implementation to match the intended game rules.

2. **Fix Custom Sense Button:** Implement proper event handling for the "Create Custom Sense" button in the Utility tab.

3. **Fix Special Attack Input Focus:** Resolve the text input re-rendering issue that causes fields to lose focus while typing.

4. **Proceed to Phase 2:** Move on to UI/UX improvements once all critical bugs are resolved.

---

## 5. Architectural Notes

This fix reinforces the importance of the **Data-Contract Violation** recipe from our architectural patterns. The expertise system's evolution from a simple activity-based structure to a hybrid system supporting both activity-based and situational formats required careful handling of backward compatibility. The defensive programming approach implemented here ensures the system can gracefully handle both data formats without crashing.
