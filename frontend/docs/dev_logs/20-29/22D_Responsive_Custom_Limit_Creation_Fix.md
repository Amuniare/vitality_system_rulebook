## Technical Debug Log: 22D - Responsive Custom Limit Creation Fix

**Problem Statement:**
The "Create Custom Limit" button on the Special Attacks tab was completely unresponsive due to two critical issues: reliance on global `document.getElementById` queries that broke component encapsulation, and event handlers receiving undefined parameters causing TypeErrors. Users could not create custom limits, and the feature failed silently across tab switches and multiple attack instances.

**Initial Hypothesis:**
The suspected root cause was improper event handling where the button's click action wasn't properly wired to the form visibility logic. The investigation focused on the event delegation chain in `SpecialAttackTab.js` and the DOM manipulation methods in `LimitSelection.js`, with particular attention to how multiple attack instances might conflict with each other.

**Investigation & Action (The Staged Approach):**

*   **Action 22D.1 (Event Handling):** In `SpecialAttackTab.js`, added event handlers for `show-custom-limit-form` and `cancel-custom-limit-form` actions to the `handleEvent` method's delegation map, enabling the controller to respond to button clicks.

*   **Action 22D.2 (Form Structure):** In `LimitSelection.js`, refactored `renderCustomLimitCreation()` to use a container-based structure with `.custom-limit-creator` wrapper, replacing the previous `RenderUtils.renderCard` approach with explicit HTML containers for better scoping.

*   **Action 22D.3 (DOM Query Scope):** In `LimitSelection.js`, implemented scoped `showCustomLimitForm(buttonElement)` and `cancelCustomLimitForm(buttonElement)` methods using `closest('.custom-limit-creator')` and `querySelector()` instead of global `getElementById`, ensuring each attack's form operates independently.

*   **Action 22D.4 (ID Removal):** In `LimitSelection.js`, removed all static `id` attributes from form inputs (`custom-limit-name`, `custom-limit-description`, `custom-limit-points`) and replaced them with CSS classes (`.custom-limit-name`, `.custom-limit-description`, `.custom-limit-points`) to prevent conflicts between multiple attack instances.

*   **Action 22D.5 (Form Submission):** In `SpecialAttackTab.js`, updated `addCustomLimit(buttonElement)` method to use scoped queries via `closest()` and `querySelector()` instead of `getElementById`, ensuring form data is read from the correct attack instance.

*   **Action 22D.6 (Validation Scope):** In `LimitSelection.js`, created `validateCustomLimitFormScoped(form)` method and updated `SpecialAttackTab.js` `validateCustomLimitForm()` to only validate visible forms, preventing cross-form validation issues.

*   **Action 22D.7 (Parameter Passing):** In `SpecialAttackTab.js`, fixed the critical issue where `handlers[action]?.()` was called with no parameters, changing it to `handlers[action]?.(e, element)` to properly pass the event and clicked element to handler functions.

**Result:**
The "Create Custom Limit" button is now fully responsive across all scenarios. Users can successfully create custom limits, the form appears and disappears correctly, validation works in real-time, and multiple special attacks operate independently without interference. The scoped query approach ensures reliable functionality across tab switches and DOM re-renders.

**Conclusion & Lesson Learned:**
The root cause was a combination of global DOM queries breaking component encapsulation and event handlers not receiving required parameters. The solution demonstrates the importance of scoped DOM manipulation using `closest()` and `querySelector()` for component isolation, and proper event parameter passing throughout the delegation chain. This pattern should be applied to all interactive components to ensure they work reliably in multi-instance scenarios and survive DOM re-renders.
