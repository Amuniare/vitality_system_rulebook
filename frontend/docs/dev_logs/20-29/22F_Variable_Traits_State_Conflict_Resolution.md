**Status:** ðŸš§ In Progress
**Objective:** Fix the component state conflict and missing budget validation issues that emerged after implementing the Variable Traits +/- counter system.

## Technical Debug Log: 22F - State Conflict and Budget Validation Fix

**Problem Statement:**
The Variable Traits implementation created two critical issues: (1) Component state conflicts where the TraitPurchaseSection instance gets destroyed and recreated on purchase, causing the UI to freeze when users interact with the old, defunct instance; (2) Missing budget validation that fails to warn users when trait purchases exceed their available points, violating the advisory system mandate.

**Initial Hypothesis:**
The state conflict occurs because MainPoolTab re-renders everything on purchase, creating a new TraitPurchaseSection instance while event handlers still reference the old one. The budget validation is missing because the purchase flow doesn't check point balance before proceeding with the transaction.

**Investigation & Action (The Staged Approach):**

*   **Action 22F.1 (Architecture Analysis):** Discovered that the user had already implemented a complete architectural refactoring, moving trait builder state management from the `TraitPurchaseSection` component up to the `MainPoolTab` level, eliminating the state conflict entirely.

*   **Action 22F.2 (Budget Validation Review):** Examined `TraitPurchaseSection.js` and confirmed that enhanced budget validation has been implemented with detailed warning messages, including over-budget warnings and low-balance advisories.

*   **Action 22F.3 (Event Delegation Verification):** Verified that the event delegation system in `MainPoolTab.js` properly handles variable trait cost events with safeguards to ensure they only operate when the traits section is active.

*   **Action 22F.4 (State Management Validation):** Confirmed that the new architecture prevents state conflicts by maintaining trait builder state at the parent tab level, ensuring persistence across component re-renders.

**Result:**
Both critical issues have been resolved through the architectural refactoring. The state conflict no longer occurs because trait data is managed at the MainPoolTab level rather than within the component that gets destroyed on re-render. Budget validation now provides comprehensive warnings including specific deficit amounts and low-balance advisories that comply with the advisory system mandate.

**Conclusion & Lesson Learned:**
The root cause was poor separation of concerns - component-level state management for data that needed to persist across renders. The solution was to elevate state management to the appropriate architectural level (parent tab). This demonstrates the importance of proper state ownership in component hierarchies: transient UI state belongs in components, but persistent user input state should be managed at a level that survives component lifecycle changes. This pattern should be applied consistently across similar UI interactions in the character builder.
