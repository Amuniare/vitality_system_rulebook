## Technical Implementation Log: 25A - Summary Tab v4 Core Architecture

**Problem Statement:**
The existing Summary Tab lacked the detailed information required for an effective "at-a-glance" character sheet. Users needed to see stat breakdown formulas (e.g., "25 = 10 (Base) + 4 (Tier) + 5 (Mobility)"), archetype descriptions, and utility ability details in a more organized two-column layout optimized for the right column containing Special Attacks.

**Initial Hypothesis:**
The reconstruction required a complete architectural overhaul following the "Read-Only & Composable" mandate with enhanced data flow from StatCalculator → CharacterBuilder → SummaryTab → Child Components, plus implementation of standardized UI patterns and CSS Grid layout.

**Investigation & Action (The Staged Approach):**

*   **Action 25A.1 (Core Data):** In `StatCalculator.js`, the `generateStatBreakdown()` method was completely rewritten to return detailed source arrays with format `{source: 'Base', value: 10}` for all calculated stats including HP, Avoidance, Durability, etc.

*   **Action 25A.2 (Data Flow):** In `CharacterBuilder.js`, added new public method `getStatBreakdowns()` that calls StatCalculator and formats breakdown data for consumption by Summary Tab components.

*   **Action 25A.3 (Layout Architecture):** In `SummaryTab.js`, refactored `render()` method to implement CSS Grid two-column layout with `summary-grid-container`, `summary-left-column`, and `summary-right-column` structure.

*   **Action 25A.4 (Enhanced Data Fetching):** In `SummaryTab.js`, added `getArchetypeDefinitions()` and `getUtilityDefinitions()` methods to fetch full descriptions from gameDataManager and pass enriched data to child components.

*   **Action 25A.5 (Component Modernization):** Updated all child components:
    - `PointPoolsSummary.js`: Converted to `summary-item` pattern with `summary-label` and `summary-value` spans
    - `AttributesSummary.js`: Major rework into separate "Core Attributes" and "Calculated Stats" cards with `stat-item-detailed` blocks showing breakdown formulas
    - `ArchetypesSummary.js`: Enhanced with `archetype-summary-item` structure including full descriptions
    - `SpecialAttacksSummary.js`: Redesigned as single tall card with enhanced attack details and `<hr>` separators
    - `UtilityAbilitiesSummary.js`: Updated with `utility-summary-item` structure and category grouping

*   **Action 25A.6 (Visual Design):** In `_summary.css`, implemented complete CSS with two-column grid, responsive design, and all new component patterns including `summary-item`, `stat-item-detailed`, `archetype-summary-item`, and `utility-summary-item`.

**Result:**
Successfully implemented a fully functional Summary Tab v4 with detailed stat breakdowns showing calculation sources, two-column responsive layout, archetype descriptions, utility ability details, and enhanced special attacks display. All components follow the "Read-Only & Composable" architecture with proper data flow.

**Conclusion & Lesson Learned:**
The key to successful large-scale component reconstruction is systematic implementation following architectural contracts and data flow patterns. The "Read-Only & Composable" mandate ensured clean separation of concerns, while standardized UI patterns created consistent user experience across all summary components.
