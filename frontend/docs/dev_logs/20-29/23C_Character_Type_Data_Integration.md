# Phase 23C: Character Type Data Integration

**Date:** 2025-01-10
**Status:** âœ… Completed
**Objective:** Replace hardcoded character type dropdown options with data from character_type.json and make HP display dynamic based on character type.

## Technical Debug Log: 23C - Character Type Data Integration

**Problem Statement:**
The character type dropdown in BasicInfoTab was using hardcoded options instead of loading from the available character_type.json data file. Additionally, the HP (Base) display was hardcoded to 100 regardless of character type, when it should reflect the HP values defined in the JSON data (ranging from 10 for Minions to 100 for Player Characters and Bosses).

**Initial Hypothesis:**
The issue was caused by missing data integration where the BasicInfoTab component was not connected to the GameDataManager system. The character_type.json file existed but was not being loaded by GameDataManager, and the UI components were not designed to use dynamic character type data for both dropdown options and HP calculations.

**Investigation & Action (The Staged Approach):**

*   **Action 23C.1 (Data File Registration):** In `GameDataManager.js`, added `characterTypes: 'data/character_type.json'` to the dataFiles object to register the character type data for loading.
*   **Action 23C.2 (Getter Method):** Added `getCharacterTypes() { return this._getData('characterTypes', []); }` method in GameDataManager to provide access to character type data.
*   **Action 23C.3 (Dynamic Options):** In `BasicInfoTab.js`, replaced hardcoded options array with `this.getCharacterTypeOptions()` method call that maps JSON data to dropdown format.
*   **Action 23C.4 (Options Mapping):** Created `getCharacterTypeOptions()` method that transforms character type JSON objects into the format expected by RenderUtils.renderSelect (value/label pairs).
*   **Action 23C.5 (Player Name Field Fix):** Updated `renderPlayerNameField()` condition from `"Player Character"` string to `"player_character"` ID to match JSON data structure.
*   **Action 23C.6 (Dynamic HP Calculation):** Added `getCharacterTypeHP()` method that looks up the current character's type in JSON data and returns the corresponding HP value.
*   **Action 23C.7 (HP Display Integration):** Modified `updateTierDisplay()` to call `getCharacterTypeHP()` instead of using hardcoded 100 for the HP (Base) display.
*   **Action 23C.8 (Real-time Updates):** Enhanced `updateCharacterType()` to trigger re-render when character type changes, ensuring HP display updates immediately.

**Result:**
The character type dropdown now displays all 8 character types from the JSON file (Player Character, Minion, Captain, Vanguard, Boss, and Vehicle variants) instead of the previous 5 hardcoded options. The HP (Base) display dynamically shows the correct value based on character type: 10 for Minions, 25 for Captains, 50 for Vanguards, and 100 for Player Characters and Bosses. Changes update in real-time when the user selects different character types.

**Conclusion & Lesson Learned:**
The root cause was incomplete data integration where UI components were not leveraging the centralized GameDataManager system. The key architectural insight is that all game data should flow through GameDataManager to maintain consistency and enable data-driven UI behavior. This pattern ensures that content changes in JSON files automatically reflect in the UI without requiring code modifications, following the data-driven design principle established in the codebase architecture.
