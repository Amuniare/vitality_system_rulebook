# Phase 22C: Custom Limit Expansion Investigation

**Date:** 2025-01-09
**Status:** ‚ùå Failed
**Objective:** Investigate and resolve the inability to expand the Create Custom Limit section in the Special Attacks tab.

---

## 1. Problem Analysis

Following the failed 22B attempt, user feedback indicated that the "Create Custom Limit" section cannot be expanded. The previous modification wrapped the form in a fixed card, but this may have removed expected expandable/collapsible behavior that users were accustomed to.

### Root Cause Investigation
Upon examining the `LimitSelection.js` component structure:

1. **Available Limits Section:** Uses expandable categories with toggle functionality via `renderLimitCategory()` method
2. **Custom Limit Creation:** Was modified to use `RenderUtils.renderCard()`, making it a fixed, always-visible element
3. **User Expectation Mismatch:** Users expect the custom limit creation to behave like other limit categories (expandable/collapsible)

The 22B modification fundamentally changed the interaction model from a potentially toggleable section to a fixed card, creating an inconsistent user experience.

## 2. Investigation Findings

**Current State Analysis:**
- `renderLimitCategory()` method provides expandable sections with `data-action="toggle-limit-category"`
- `expandedCategories` Set tracks which categories are expanded
- Custom limit creation lacks any toggle mechanism after 22B changes

**Expected Behavior:**
Based on the UI pattern established in the same component, the custom limit creation should probably be:
1. An expandable section similar to limit categories
2. Collapsible to reduce UI clutter when not needed
3. Consistent with the interaction patterns of nearby elements

**Architecture Conflict:**
The change to `RenderUtils.renderCard()` created a static element that doesn't fit the dynamic expand/collapse pattern used elsewhere in the limits section.

## 3. Failure Analysis & Lessons Learned

**Why Investigation Failed:**
1. **Insufficient Requirements Gathering:** Did not determine the original intended behavior for custom limit creation
2. **Pattern Inconsistency:** Failed to identify that custom limits should follow the same expandable pattern as other categories
3. **Missing Toggle Implementation:** No investigation into whether a toggle mechanism should be added

**Architectural Impact:**
- **User Experience Regression:** Created inconsistent interaction patterns within the same component
- **Lost Functionality:** Potentially removed expandable behavior that users expected
- **Technical Debt:** Left the component in an inconsistent state with mixed interaction patterns

**Lessons Learned:**
- **Analyze Existing Patterns:** Before modifying UI components, analyze how similar elements in the same area behave
- **User Expectation Research:** "Can't expand" suggests users had prior experience with expandable behavior
- **Consistent Interaction Models:** All related elements in a section should follow the same interaction patterns

**Next Steps Required:**
1. Determine if custom limit creation should be expandable like other categories
2. If yes, implement toggle functionality with `data-action` and state management
3. If no, investigate why users expect expansion behavior

## 4. Files Analyzed

- `features/special-attacks/components/LimitSelection.js` - Examined renderLimitCategory() vs renderCustomLimitCreation() patterns
- No files modified - investigation only

## 5. Status & Recommendations

**Current Status:** Problem remains unresolved. The custom limit creation section is not expandable, contrary to user expectations.

**Immediate Recommendations:**
1. **Priority 1:** Determine the intended interaction model for custom limit creation
2. **Priority 2:** If expandable behavior is desired, implement toggle functionality matching the limit category pattern
3. **Priority 3:** If fixed behavior is desired, investigate why users expect expansion

**Technical Approach for Resolution:**
If expandable behavior is confirmed as the requirement, the solution would involve:
- Adding toggle state management for custom limit creation
- Implementing `data-action="toggle-custom-limit-creation"` functionality
- Adding expand/collapse icon similar to limit categories
- Ensuring consistent styling while maintaining expandable behavior
