## Technical Debug Log: 25B - Data Contract Violation Resolution

**Problem Statement:**
After implementing Summary Tab v4, the tab displayed completely blank with no error messages in the UI. JavaScript execution was halting during the render process, preventing any HTML from being assigned to the tab content, indicating a critical data contract violation between components and the underlying data model.

**Initial Hypothesis:**
The blank screen suggested a fundamental mismatch between what components expected from the data model and what was actually provided. The issue was likely occurring early in the render pipeline, preventing subsequent components from rendering.

**Investigation & Action (The Staged Approach):**

*   **Action 25B.1 (Initial Diagnosis):** Applied DATA_CONTRACT_VIOLATION recipe by examining the render pipeline starting with the first component call in `SummaryTab.js` → `SummaryHeader.render(character)`.

*   **Action 25B.2 (Root Cause Identification):** In `SummaryHeader.js`, discovered critical violation where code attempted to access `character.basicInfo?.characterName` but the VitalityCharacter data model stores properties directly on the character object (e.g., `character.name`).

*   **Action 25B.3 (Primary Fix):** In `SummaryHeader.js`, corrected all data access patterns from `character.basicInfo.*` to direct `character.*` properties and updated UI patterns from `stat-item` to `summary-item` with proper `summary-label` and `summary-value` classes.

*   **Action 25B.4 (Secondary Violations):** In `SummaryTab.js`, fixed additional violations in `getUtilityDefinitions()` method:
    - Corrected GameDataManager method calls from `getFeatures()` to `getAvailableFeatures()` and `getSenses()` to `getAvailableSenses()`
    - Implemented `findDefinitionInTiers()` helper function to properly iterate through tiered data structure instead of calling `.find()` directly on objects

*   **Action 25B.5 (Final Protection):** Added `Array.isArray(purchases)` check in utility processing to prevent `TypeError: purchases.forEach is not a function` when utility purchase categories contain non-array data.

**Result:**
Summary Tab now renders completely with all components displaying correctly. The DATA_CONTRACT_VIOLATION debugging protocol successfully identified and resolved three levels of data contract mismatches: basic property access, method naming, and data structure assumptions.

**Conclusion & Lesson Learned:**
The DATA_CONTRACT_VIOLATION recipe proved essential for systematic debugging of component integration issues. The key insight is that blank screens often indicate fundamental data model mismatches occurring early in the render pipeline. Proper data contract alignment requires checking not just property names but also data structure assumptions (arrays vs objects, tiered vs flat data).
