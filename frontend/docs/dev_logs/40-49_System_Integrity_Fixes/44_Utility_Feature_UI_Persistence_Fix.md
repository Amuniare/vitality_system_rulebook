# Phase 44: Utility Feature UI Persistence Fix

**Date:** 2025-06-19
**Status:** âœ… Completed
**Objective:** Fix utility features disappearing after selection by implementing a grey-out behavior instead of hiding purchased items.

---

## 1. Problem Analysis

The utility tab had a confusing UX issue where utility features would completely disappear from view after being purchased. This made it difficult for users to track what they had already selected and created an inconsistent interface compared to other tabs where purchased items remain visible but disabled.

### Root Cause

The `GenericUtilitySection.js` component was using a filter operation that completely removed purchased items from the display list:

```javascript
const availableItems = allItems.filter(item => !purchasedItems.some(p => p.id === item.id));
```

This approach prioritized a "clean" interface over user visibility and tracking of selections.

## 2. Solution Implemented

Modified the utility feature display logic to show all items but visually distinguish purchased items through existing disabled/selected CSS classes instead of hiding them entirely.

### Key Changes:
*   **GenericUtilitySection.js:** Removed the filter that hid purchased items and replaced it with conditional rendering logic that marks purchased items as disabled.
*   **Visual State Management:** Implemented `isPurchased` check to set appropriate `disabled`, `clickable`, and `status` properties for each item.
*   **UI Consistency:** Updated section title from "Available ${title}" to just "${title}" to reflect that both available and purchased items are now shown.

```javascript
// BEFORE: Items disappeared after purchase
const availableItems = allItems.filter(item => !purchasedItems.some(p => p.id === item.id));

// AFTER: All items shown, purchased ones greyed out  
const isPurchased = purchasedItems.some(p => p.id === item.id);
return RenderUtils.renderCard({
    title: item.name, cost: item.cost, description: item.description,
    status: isPurchased ? 'purchased' : 'available',
    clickable: !isPurchased, disabled: isPurchased,
    dataAttributes: isPurchased ? {} : { /* purchase data */ }
});
```

## 3. Verification Results

âœ… **UI Persistence:** Utility features now remain visible after purchase
âœ… **Visual Feedback:** Purchased items are properly greyed out using existing CSS classes
âœ… **Interaction Prevention:** Disabled items cannot be clicked or re-purchased
âœ… **Data Integrity:** Purchase tracking and point deduction continue to work correctly

---

## 4. Impact Assessment

**Positive Outcomes:**
- Improved user experience with better visibility of selections
- Consistent behavior with other character builder tabs
- Leveraged existing CSS infrastructure without requiring new styling

**No Breaking Changes:** The modification only affects display logic and maintains all existing functionality for purchase tracking and point management.
