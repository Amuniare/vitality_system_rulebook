# Frontend CLAUDE.md

This file contains AI collaboration instructions and context for the frontend portion of the Vitality System Rulebook project.

## Project Structure

The frontend contains several key components:
- `character-builder/` - Interactive character creation tool
- `campaigns/` - Campaign-specific content and session summaries
- `rules/` - Rule viewer and reference materials

## Development Guidelines

When working on frontend code, follow these principles:
1. Maintain existing code conventions and patterns
2. Use the established CSS architecture with modular components
3. Follow the event handling patterns established in the character builder
4. Ensure responsive design principles are maintained

## Common Tasks

### Character Builder
- Located in `character-builder/`
- Uses vanilla JavaScript with modular architecture
- CSS follows BEM-like naming conventions
- Event handling is decentralized to individual components

### Rules Viewer
- Located in `rules/`
- Simple HTML/CSS/JS structure for rule reference

### Campaigns
- Static content with session summaries and campaign materials
