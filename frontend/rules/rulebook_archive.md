**3D6 Rolls**

- **Rolling a 6**: When you roll a 6, roll an additional d6 and add it to the total. These additional dice can also allow you to roll an extra die if they land on a 6. Add all dice rolled to the total.

### **ATTRIBUTES**
Attributes represent what type of things your character is good at in combat and utility situations.

- If you beat that number you may choose to remain concious. 
- If you fail, you fall unconcious.
- If you fail by 20 or more, you die.
- Rolling a Natural 20 returns you to 1 HP.
- Rolling a Nautral 1 gives an additional -5 to your result.


Any damage taken while at or below 0 HP forces you to make another Survival Check. 

**Resting and HP Recovery:** After a period of time of little to no activity based on the setting you recover HP, Efforts, and the uses of certain abilities.

- **Gritty Setting**: A rest occurs after 8 hours of inactivity, during which you regain 10 HP per hour.

- End all conditions on yourself. 
- Take an extra Primary Action or Reaction. 
- Move your up to your full Movement speed again. 
- Increase your Capacity by 2.
- Perform a special action or ability at the GMs discretion. 

After using an Effort, at the start of your next turn, reduced your Tier by 1 for each Effort used until you complete a rest.

# SECTION 7: SPECIAL ATTACKS

### **BASIC RULES**
**Special Attack Allocation:** You get Special Attacks equal to your Tier, unless otherwise specified by your Special Attack Archetype  
**Starting Points:** No base points unless granted by your Special Attack Archetype  
**Point Generation:** Take Limits on attacks to gain points for Upgrades, unless your archetype doesn't let you take limits

### **POINT CALCULATION FROM LIMITS**
**Limit Value Scaling:**
- **First (Tier × 10) points of Limits** → Full value
- **Next (Tier × 20) points of Limits** → Half value  
- **All remaining Limit points** → Quarter value

**Example (Tier 5):**
- 50 points of Limits = 50 upgrade points
- 100 points of Limits = 75 upgrade points  
- 150 points of Limits = 100 upgrade points
- 250 points of Limits = 125 upgrade points

**Breaking Down the Math (Tier 5 Example):**
- **250 Points of Limits:** 50×1.0 + 100×0.5 + 100×0.25 = 125 upgrade points

**Limit Restrictions:**
You cannot take a limit, if you are unlikely or unable to suffer the downside, or if more than half of the effect of the limit is mitigated by other means.
**Examples:**
- Charge-Up / Extended Charge-Up, and Cooldown 2
- Cooldown 3 and Reserves 3

## Features

Abilities that enable entirely new categories of actions and checks impossible through standard character capabilities. Features grant access to supernatural effects, reality manipulation, or fundamentally new interaction methods with the game world.

**Global Setting Example:**
- Poor: -2p
- Comfortable: Base
- Well Off: 2p
- Wealthy: 5p and a narrative justification

**Failure Consequences:** When checks fail for purchases, characters may face complications such as drawing unwanted attention, creating debts, damaging relationships, or receiving inferior goods. The GM determines appropriate consequences based on the situation and the nature of the failed attempt.
