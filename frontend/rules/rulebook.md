**Point Pools**
- Utility Points: 5 × (Tier) points
- Can be spend on Features, Senses, Movement Abilites, or Descriptors


## Features

Abilities that enable entirely new categories of actions and checks impossible through standard character capabilities. Features grant access to supernatural effects, reality manipulation, or fundamentally new interaction methods with the game world.

**Core Principle:** Features allow you to make checks you normally couldn't make. They create new possibilities rather than enhancing existing ones.

**Cost Structure:** 1, 3, 5, or 10 utility points based on mechanical impact and scope of new capabilities enabled.


Here are the features organized alphabetically within their point categories:

### **1 Point Features**

**Multi-limbed**
You have additional limbs. Each purchase of this feature grants you one extra limb.

**Natural Communication**

**Distinguished Background**
Your distinct heritage, noble birth, or foreign origin marks you as notable wherever you go.

The familiar can scout dangerous areas, retrieve objects, or act as a distraction.

**Forbiddance**
Once per rest, over the course of an hour, you may create a ward that protects up to a 100 by 100 space area from observation, teleportation, and communication through the barrier.

### Unique Senses

**Unique Sense (Variable)**
Gain a supernatural sense for a specific phenomenon within 10 spaces at Tier 1, doubling each additional Tier. You automatically detect obvious manifestations; subtle ones require opposed Awareness checks. Examples include effects from a Descriptor (Electricity, Space, Time, Magic), a type of being (Human, divine beings, eldritch horror, powered person), or usage of an ability (Teleporting, Burrowing, specific Feature usage).



## Movement

Enhanced locomotion capabilities that function seamlessly during combat. Movement abilities integrate with your movement action and require no skill checks or preparation time.

**Core Principle:** Movement abilities modify how you can move during combat turns. They activate instantly and integrate with your base movement speed and actions.
**Point Cost:** Based on tactical advantage and versatility in combat situations.
**Combat Integration:** All movement abilities work with your base movement speed and can be split before and after other actions on your turn.

### Movement (5p)

**Wall Walking**
Move on walls and ceilings at normal speed, defying gravity on solid surfaces. You can change orientation as part of your movement without spending additional actions.

**Burrowing** 
Move through earth, sand, or loose rock at half speed. You create temporary tunnels that collapse after you pass unless you spend a Primary Action to make them permanent.

### Movement (10p)

**Flight**
Move in any direction at full speed with perfect maneuverability. You can hover in place and are unaffected by ground-based obstacles or terrain penalties.

**Phasing**
Selectively phase parts of your body or your entire body through solid barriers. You can move through walls, floors, and other solid objects at normal speed. You must end your movement in an unoccupied space.

**Short-Range Teleportation**
Instantly teleport to any visible location within your movement range. This movement ignores obstacles and opportunity attacks. You cannot teleport to occupied spaces or locations you cannot clearly see.

**Portal Creation**
Create two linked portals as part of your movement action. Each portal occupies one space and can be placed anywhere within your movement range. Your movement is consumed equal to the total distance between both portal locations. Any creature or object can move through either portal to instantly emerge from the other. Portals persist until the start of your next turn or until you create new ones. Only one pair of portals can exist at a time.

**Global Setting Example:**
- Poor: -2p
- Comfortable: Base
- Well Off: 2p
- Wealthy: 5p and a narrative justification

**Mutants Setting Example:**
