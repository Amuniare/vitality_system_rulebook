# World Building

## Historical Context

### The Mutant Rebellion (2010-2020)
A decade of dramatic change began with the Mutant Liberation Front emerging from underground networks. Zeus and Override transformed peaceful resistance into revolutionary force, culminating in the Paris Event where 90% of the city's population gained mutations while 10% perished.

### Override's Technological Impact
Override's interference created a persistent "echo" in electronic systems that could unpredictably disrupt unhardened technology. This forced global infrastructure rebuilding with mechanical backups and specialized hardening, effectively causing a 20-year technological regression.

### The Fragile Recovery (2020-2025)
Governments implemented cautious policies balancing control with concession. The current licensing system emerged, where mutants can become registered heroes through expensive independent paths or corporate sponsorship programs.

### Current Era (2025-2030)
Corporate influence dominates mutant policy through insurance-based licensing, private security contracting, and sponsored research. Regional approaches vary dramatically worldwide.

## Seattle Districts and Demographics

### Overall Population Distribution
- City-wide mutant population: 5%
- Significant variation by district based on economic factors
- Higher concentrations in lower-income areas due to economic barriers

### High-Income Areas (1% mutant population)
- Almost entirely registered mutants
- High proportion of corporate-sponsored individuals
- Strict monitoring and enforcement protocols
- Regular "community integration events" for media coverage

### Middle-Income Areas (2% mutant population)
- Mix of registered and unregistered residents
- Some corporate sponsorship opportunities
- Moderate monitoring with selective enforcement
- Tension between normal life and avoiding scrutiny

### Low-Income Areas (8-10% mutant population)
- Mostly unregistered due to cost barriers
- Limited corporate presence or interest
- Minimal monitoring except during incidents
- Strong informal community networks for mutual protection

### Specific District Profiles

#### Downtown Core (Downtown, First Hill, Pioneer Square)
- Commercial heart with 2% visible mutant population
- Corporate offices, government buildings, professional facades
- Standard security screening at major buildings
- Business associations share influence over district policies

#### Capitol Hill-Central (Cultural District)
- 4% mutant population with higher visibility in arts/nightlife
- Mix of residential, entertainment venues, local businesses
- Cultural events regularly transform public spaces
- Ongoing gentrification creating community tensions

#### Industrial District (Georgetown, South Park, SODO)
- 5% mutant population in working-class jobs
- Warehouses, factories, shipping operations
- Traditional security focused on property protection
- Community organizations in converted commercial spaces

## Mutant Detection and Surveillance

### Detection Methods
- No 100% reliable mutant detection technology exists
- Primarily identified through visible appearance differences
- Blood tests detect some physiological mutations (partial coverage)
- Intensive DNA testing has false negatives and some false positives
- Corporate research ongoing for more reliable detection methods

### Surveillance Infrastructure
- Automated checkpoints between major districts
- Biometric verification systems in corporate zones
- Handheld scanners for registration verification
- Private security varying by district and ownership
- "Smart city" technology testing in innovation corridors

### Registration and Licensing System

#### Corporate-Sponsored Path
- Company pays insurance and licensing costs
- More restricted but financially accessible
- Corporate legal responsibility for sponsored individuals
- Can work as heroes or in regular positions
- Most common path due to financial barriers

#### Independent Licensed Path
- Extremely expensive personal insurance requirements
- Maximum freedom but highest financial cost
- Direct government oversight from ULMH
- Rare due to prohibitive costs
- Often limited to wealthy individuals or those with profitable powers

## Business and Economic Practices

### Corporate Integration
- Most businesses operate "don't ask, don't tell" policies
- Informal networks identify "safe" businesses through coded reviews
- Corporate chains require strict compliance and detailed records
- Independent businesses often have unofficial accommodations

### Underground Economy
- Secret medical clinics using older but reliable equipment
- Safe house networks for emergency relocation
- Hidden supply caches and resource distribution
- Rotating meeting spaces with sophisticated security

### Mutant-Specific Facilities
- Public: Licensed medical facilities, community centers, corporate recreation
- Semi-Private: Clubs with unofficial clientele, "friendly" businesses
- Underground: Emergency shelters, hidden medical care, meeting spaces

## International Context

### European Union
- Higher mutant integration rates following Paris Event
- Autonomous zones in several major cities
- Complex diplomatic relationships with mutant communities
- Advanced mutant rights legislation
- 10-15% mutant population in affected regions

### Asia
- Strict segregation policies in most countries
- Heavy technological monitoring systems
- Limited mutant rights and representation
- Military-focused containment approaches
- Variable enforcement by specific nation

### South America
- Autonomous mutant zones with informal governance
- Limited corporate influence in remote areas
- Indigenous mutant communities with traditional structures
- Less technological infrastructure for monitoring

### United States
- Corporate-influenced hybrid approach varies by state
- Insurance-based regulation through ULMH system
- Public-private security partnerships
- Ongoing social tensions and political debates
- Federal oversight through task forces and committees

## Technology and Infrastructure

### Override-Resistant Technology
- Hardened circuits with mechanical failsafe systems
- Redundant communication networks with backup protocols
- Hybrid power distribution combining multiple approaches
- Emergency protocols for system failures
- Certification requirements for critical infrastructure

### Ongoing Challenges
- Override "echo" remains detectable in many systems
- Technopathic mutants can sense ghostly presence in electronics
- Unpredictable disruptions require constant vigilance
- Higher costs for hardened vs standard technology
- Balance between functionality and resistance requirements
