## The Setting: Year 009.M42

The campaign is set in **009.M42** (the 9th year of the 42nd millennium), approximately 41,009 years from our current era. This is a time of unprecedented crisis for humanity. The galaxy has been literally torn in half by the **Great Rift (Cicatrix Maledictum)**—a massive tear in reality that divides the Imperium into two halves: Imperium Sanctus (the "light" side where Terra remains) and Imperium Nihilus (the "dark" side cut off from the Emperor's light).

**Why This Matters**: As Rogue Traders, you operate in the most dangerous period in Imperial history. Traditional supply lines are broken, entire sectors are isolated, and desperate times create unprecedented opportunities for those bold enough to seize them.

## The Imperium of Man: Humanity's Last Hope

Humanity lives under the **Imperium of Man**—a brutal, fascist theocracy that worships the undying **God-Emperor of Mankind**. For over 10,000 years, the Imperium has fought endless wars against three primary threats:

### **Chaos** - The Dark Gods of the Warp
The four Chaos Gods (Khorne, Tzeentch, Nurgle, Slaanesh) and their mortal followers, including **Traitor Space Marines** who turned against the Emperor 10,000 years ago. Chaos corruption spreads through thought, emotion, and contact with Warp energy.

### **Xenos** - Alien Threats
- **Orks**: Savage fungoid warriors who grow stronger through violence
- **Tyranids**: Galactic locusts that devour all organic matter
- **Eldar**: Ancient, declining species with incredible psychic powers
- **Tau**: Young, technologically advanced empire promoting "the Greater Good"
- **Necrons**: Ancient robotic beings awakening to reclaim the galaxy

### **Internal Threats** - Heresy from Within
Heretics, mutants, cultists, and anyone who questions Imperial orthodoxy. The **Inquisition** serves as the Emperor's secret police with authority to investigate and eliminate such threats.

## Essential Imperial Concepts

### **The God-Emperor of Mankind**
The Master of Mankind sits upon the **Golden Throne** on Terra, physically dead yet spiritually transcendent. His psychic will maintains the **Astronomican** (the psychic lighthouse that enables faster-than-light travel) and battles Chaos Gods in the Warp. All Imperial authority derives from His divine mandate.

**For Rogue Traders**: Your **Warrant of Trade** carries His personal seal, making it one of the most powerful legal documents in existence.

### **The Warp** - The Sea of Souls
A parallel dimension of pure psychic energy and emotion, necessary for faster-than-light travel but inhabited by **daemons** and the Chaos Gods. Ships must use **Gellar Fields** for protection and **Navigators** for guidance when traveling through the Warp.

### **Space Marines (Adeptus Astartes)**
Genetically enhanced super-soldiers created from the Emperor's genetic templates. Organized into roughly 1,000 Chapters of about 1,000 warriors each. **Primaris Marines** are a new, enhanced generation recently introduced by Roboute Guilliman.

**For Rogue Traders**: Space Marines never serve directly under your authority, but may cooperate for mutual benefit against common threats.

### **The Primarchs**
The Emperor's 18 demigod sons who originally led the Space Marine Legions. Nine turned traitor during the **Horus Heresy** 10,000 years ago. **Roboute Guilliman** has recently returned and now serves as **Lord Commander of the Imperium**, effectively ruling in the Emperor's name.

### **Rogue Traders**
Individuals bearing a **Warrant of Trade**—the Emperor's personal authorization to explore, trade, and make war beyond Imperial borders. You hold authority equivalent to **Planetary Governors** and can speak with the Emperor's voice in frontier regions.

### **The Astronomican**
The psychic lighthouse powered by the Emperor's will that allows **Navigators** to guide ships through the Warp. Its range has shrunk from 70,000 to 50,000 light-years due to the Great Rift, creating effective Imperial borders.

---

## The Current Crisis (009.M42)

### **The Great Rift**
A galaxy-spanning Warp storm created when **Cadia** was destroyed during Abaddon the Despoiler's 13th Black Crusade. This permanent tear in reality:
- Divides the Imperium in half
- Makes Warp travel far more dangerous
- Allows daemons to manifest freely in many regions
- Creates time distortions where years may pass in one system while days pass in another

### **The Indomitus Crusade**
Guilliman's massive military campaign to reunite the divided Imperium and establish new supply lines. **This is why Rogue Traders like yourselves have been summoned**—traditional Imperial logistics cannot reach many isolated regions.

### **Resource Crisis**
The galaxy-wide warfare and broken supply lines create:
- Massive demand for basic supplies in isolated systems
- Premium pricing for goods crossing the Great Rift
- Unprecedented opportunities for profitable trade routes
- Critical need for alternative supply networks (your specialty)

---

## Technology in the 41st Millennium

### **The Machine Cult**
The **Adeptus Mechanicus** (Tech-Priests of Mars) control all advanced technology and worship machines as sacred. They believe technology contains **machine spirits** that must be properly honored through ritual and prayer.

### **Standard Template Constructs (STCs)**
Ancient databases containing complete manufacturing instructions for any device humanity might need. Finding even partial STC data can transform entire sectors and is worth more than whole star systems.

### **Forbidden Technology**
- **Artificial Intelligence**: Absolutely prohibited due to the **Men of Iron** rebellion
- **Chaos Technology**: Devices corrupted by Warp energy
- **Xenotech**: Alien technology (some exceptions for Rogue Traders)

**For Rogue Traders**: Beyond Imperial borders, you have greater freedom to study and trade certain forbidden technologies, making you valuable intermediaries.

---

## Imperial Authority Structure

### **High Lords of Terra**
The twelve-member council that rules the Imperium in the Emperor's name, currently led by **Roboute Guilliman** as Imperial Regent.

### **Sector Governors**
Rule 200-1,000 star systems each. You hold equivalent rank to these powerful nobles.

### **Planetary Governors**
Control individual worlds. Your Warrant grants authority equal to theirs within Imperial space and superior authority beyond Imperial borders.

### **The Inquisition**
Secret police with authority to investigate any threat. They can override most Imperial authority but generally respect Rogue Trader privileges, especially when cooperation serves Imperial interests.

**For Rogue Traders**: You operate within this hierarchy while enjoying unique privileges that allow independence beyond Imperial borders.

## Warp Travel: The Lifeline of the Imperium

Faster-than-light travel requires entering the Warp, a parallel dimension where time and distance work differently. All Warp travel requires:

### **Essential Components**
- **Warp Drive**: Allows translation into and out of the Warp
- **Gellar Field**: Protective barrier against daemon incursion
- **Navigator**: Psychically gifted individual who can perceive the Astronomican
- **Astropath**: Psyker for faster-than-light communication

### **Warp Travel Times**
The relationship between real time and warp time varies dramatically:

| Light Years | Minimum Warp Time | Maximum Warp Time | Minimum Real Time | Maximum Real Time |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| 1           | 2 mins           | 6 mins           | 43 mins          | 4½ hrs           |
| 5           | 7 mins           | 30 mins          | 3½ hrs           | 1 day            |
| 10          | 14 mins          | 1 hour           | 7 hrs            | 2 days           |
| 50          | 1¼ hrs           | 4¼ hrs           | 1½ days          | 9 days           |
| 100         | 2¼ hrs           | 9½ hrs           | 3 days           | 3 weeks          |
| 500         | 12 hrs           | 2 days           | 2 weeks          | 3 months         |
| 1,000       | 1 day            | 4 days           | 1 month          | 6 months         |
| 5,000       | 5 days           | 3 weeks          | 5 months         | 3 years          |

**Note**: These times don't include journey times to and from jump points, which can take days to weeks within star systems.

### **Current Warp Conditions**
Post-Great Rift travel is far more dangerous:
- Increased daemon activity in the Warp
- Frequent Gellar Field failures
- Warp storms blocking traditional routes
- Time distortions more severe and unpredictable

- Cooperation from Imperial organizations
- Morale for your crew in dangerous situations

### **Common Prayers and Phrases**

- **"Knowledge is power, guard it well"**: Acknowledgment of information's value

---

*In the grim darkness of the far future, there is only war—but those who bear the Emperor's Warrant possess the power to choose which battles to fight and which alliances to forge. Your decisions will echo across the galaxy, shaping the fate of millions and determining whether humanity's light endures or dies in the endless night.*
