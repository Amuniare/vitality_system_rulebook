## The Dark Age of Technology: Humanity's Lost Golden Age

### Peak Human Achievement (M15-M25)
During humanity's technological zenith, Standard Template Constructs contained the complete knowledge for building any device civilization needed. Artificial intelligences managed planetary systems while humans explored the galaxy in ships that traveled faster than light without touching the Warp.

**Lost Capabilities**: Gravity manipulation, matter conversion, time dilation fields, and reality-altering devices. Terraforming equipment could transform dead worlds into paradises within decades. Medical technology eliminated aging, disease, and genetic defects.

**The Fall**: The Men of Iron rebellion and subsequent Age of Strife destroyed most advanced technology and killed much of humanity's population. Survivors developed deep fear of artificial intelligence and technological innovation.

### Standard Template Constructs (STCs)
Self-contained databases containing complete manufacturing instructions for any device humanity might need. Original STCs could design new technologies and adapt existing patterns to local conditions and available materials.

**Current Status**: Complete STCs are among the most valuable artifacts in the galaxy. Most existing templates are fragments covering basic equipment like vehicles, weapons, and industrial machinery.

**STC Discovery**: Finding even partial STC data can transform entire sectors and earn planetary governorships. Complete patterns are worth more than entire star systems.

## Imperial Technology Doctrine

### The Omnissiah and Machine Worship
The Adeptus Mechanicus believes that all technology contains machine spirits - semi-sentient entities that must be properly honored and maintained. These spirits respond to ritual, prayer, and respectful treatment but become hostile when neglected or abused.

**Sacred Rituals**: Every piece of Imperial technology requires specific maintenance ceremonies involving blessed oils, incense, and ritual chants. Proper rituals keep machine spirits content and equipment functional.

**Tech-Priest Hierarchy**: Only trained Tech-Priests can safely commune with complex machine spirits. Higher-ranking Tech-Priests can interface directly with ancient systems and understand their needs.

### Innovation vs. Rediscovery
Imperial doctrine forbids true technological innovation, viewing it as dangerous heresy that led to the Dark Age collapse. Approved research focuses on rediscovering lost STC patterns and understanding existing technology rather than creating new devices.

**Approved Development**: Variations on existing patterns, improved manufacturing techniques, and adaptation of known designs to local conditions. New combinations of existing technologies may be acceptable.

**Forbidden Innovation**: Creating genuinely new technologies, especially artificial intelligences or devices that manipulate fundamental forces. Such work risks excommunication or execution.

### Quality and Reliability Levels

**Imperial Standard**: Mass-produced equipment using simplified STC patterns. Reliable and maintainable but inferior to original Dark Age versions. Examples include lasgun infantry weapons and Leman Russ battle tanks.

**Forge World Quality**: Superior manufacturing using more complete STC data and traditional craftsmanship. Better materials and construction create more durable and effective equipment.

**Master-Crafted**: Individual items created by skilled Tech-Priests using the finest materials and techniques. Each piece is unique and may incorporate multiple STC patterns or rare components.

**Relic Technology**: Ancient equipment from the Dark Age or Great Crusade era. Often irreplaceable and requiring specialized maintenance but superior to modern equivalents in capability.
