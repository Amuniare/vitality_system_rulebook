## **Necron Lord: Vorthak the Strategist**

### **Core Motivation & Methods**
**Primary Goal:** Testing current galactic military capabilities while positioning for major expansion
- **Strategic Patience:** Deliberately allows conflicts to unfold, gathering intelligence on Space Marine tactics, Chaos corruption methods, and local resistance capabilities
- **Calculated Awakening:** Only awakening select tomb sections to avoid attracting massive Imperial response while he prepares
- **Fortress World Vision:** Plans to transform this world into an impregnable staging ground for Necron expansion into the sector

### **The Horrific Side Project**
**Biotransference Experiments on Space Marines:**
- **Location:** Deep tomb laboratories, several levels below where the Space Wolves initially fought
- **Test Subjects:** Some of the "missing" Blood Claws and Grey Hunters aren't dead - they're being experimented on
- **Goal:** Attempting to implant Necron consciousness matrices into enhanced human physiology
- **Hypothesis:** Space Marine gene-seed might be compatible with Necron technology, creating superior hybrid warriors
- **Current Status:** Early experiments showing "promising" results - part organic superhuman, part living metal horror

### **Tactical Approach**
- **Intelligence Gathering:** Uses scarab swarms and wraith reconnaissance to monitor all faction movements
- **Weakness Assessment:** Allows each faction to reveal their capabilities through conflict
- **Surgical Strikes:** Only intervenes when factions grow too unified or effective
- **Psychological Warfare:** May eventually reveal the Space Marine experiments to demoralize the Space Wolves

This gives you great hooks for:
- **Rescue missions** into the deep tomb
- **Horror reveals** when they find their transformed battle-brothers
- **Moral dilemmas** about whether these hybrids can be saved or must be destroyed
- **Intelligence warfare** as Vorthak learns their tactics
