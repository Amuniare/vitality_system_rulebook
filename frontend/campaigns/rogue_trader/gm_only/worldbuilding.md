*The Great Rift has shattered the galaxy, creating unprecedented dangers and opportunities for Rogue Trader dynasties. This comprehensive guide covers the essential knowledge needed to navigate the post-Cicatrix Maledictum galaxy, where ancient powers clash amid the twilight of the 41st Millennium.*

---

## Imperial Core: The Foundation of Human Civilization

### The Emperor of Mankind
The Master of Mankind sits upon the Golden Throne, physically dead yet spiritually transcendent after 10,000 years of torment. **His psychic will extends across hundreds of billions of worlds**, maintaining the Astronomican and battling Chaos Gods in the Warp. Roboute Guilliman describes Him as having lost His humanity, becoming cold and distant—a divine force rather than a benevolent father. The Emperor's potential awakening grows stronger with the Great Rift's power, possibly marking the end of the current era.

**For Rogue Traders**: Your Warrant of Trade derives its ultimate authority from His name. The Emperor's guidance through Tarot readings can influence major decisions, while religious devotion to Him provides crucial protection against Chaos corruption during dangerous Warp journeys.

### The Golden Throne
This Dark Age relic slowly fails with mechanisms beyond current Imperial understanding. The Throne now requires **exponentially increasing psyker sacrifices**—4,000 daily compared to 1,000 in early M41. Dark Eldar provided temporary repairs in exchange for access and slaves, delaying failure by centuries. The Talisman of Seven Hammers serves as a dead man's switch—if the Throne fails, Terra dies with it.

**For Rogue Traders**: Its potential failure timeline affects all long-term strategic planning. Technology that could extend its function would be of incalculable value. The Throne's critical status creates opportunities for those willing to take extreme risks in pursuit of solutions.

### The Astronomican
The psychic lighthouse's range has shrunk from 70,000 to 50,000 light years due to increased Warp instability. During the Noctis Aeterna, the beacon went dark for varying periods—33 days on Terra, months or years elsewhere. **Regions of Imperium Nihilus still cannot detect the beacon**, forcing dangerous blind jumps. Ironically, the same beacon that enables human expansion also draws Tyranid hive fleets to the galaxy.

**For Rogue Traders**: Range limitations create effective Imperial borders and define where you can operate safely. Regions beyond beacon range offer high-risk, high-reward opportunities. Alternative navigation methods like Webway access would be revolutionary for your operations.

### Imperial Cult & Ecclesiarchy
The Adeptus Ministorum faces theological crisis with Guilliman's return and his apparent stance against the Emperor's divinity. The organization adapts by worshipping Guilliman as a living saint while maintaining the Emperor's godhood. **Enhanced power in Dark Imperium regions** where Imperial authority is weakened provides new opportunities for missionary work.

**For Rogue Traders**: Religious authority legitimizes conquests and trading agreements. The Ecclesiarchy provides personnel, funding, and military support. Theological flexibility allows adaptation of local beliefs to Imperial framework, making world integration easier.

### Imperial Technology Doctrine
The Adeptus Mechanicus clings to Standard Template Constructs while forbidding innovation. Some Forge Worlds isolated in the Dark Imperium develop dangerous independence. **Desperate attempts to repair the Golden Throne lead to forbidden research**, while Primaris Marine technology represents rare approved innovation under Belisarius Cawl's influence.

**For Rogue Traders**: Beyond Imperial borders, you can legally trade certain xenotech and develop new designs. The critical need for solutions to the Golden Throne failure creates unprecedented opportunities for technological discovery and trade.

## Imperial Factions: The Imperium's Defenders

### Space Marines & Primaris Marines
The Great Rift devastated the Adeptus Astartes—**nearly half of all 1,000 Chapters remain unaccounted for** with twelve homeworlds confirmed destroyed. The Ultima Founding created hundreds of new all-Primaris Chapters, while 94% of surviving Chapters accepted Primaris reinforcements. The dangerous Rubicon Primaris procedure allows Firstborn Marines to cross the threshold.

**For Rogue Traders**: Space Marine detachments are extremely rare but invaluable. Some Chapters enter mutual benefit pacts with powerful dynasties. Post-Rift desperation may increase cooperation possibilities, though they never serve directly under Warrant authority.

### Imperial Guard/Astra Militarum
Massive mobilization on unprecedented scale has created critical manpower shortages, with entire hive cities conscripted. Cadia's fall devastated Guard morale and identity. **Stretched forces leave many worlds undefended** as regiments deploy to crusades across the galaxy.

**For Rogue Traders**: Veterans provide excellent recruitment opportunities. Some regiments are available for hire by wealthy dynasties. Guard forces can provide security for trade routes and participate in joint operations beyond Imperial borders.

### Adeptus Mechanicus
All Forge Worlds ordered to increase production to unprecedented levels, **stripping entire star systems for raw materials**. Seven major Forge Worlds destroyed entirely. Many Explorator fleets cut off from home bases, creating opportunities for independent agreements.

**For Rogue Traders**: Essential for ship maintenance and advanced technology. Tech-priests are invaluable for void operations. Long-standing ancient pacts obligate Mechanicus supply to Rogue Traders, making you among their five major trading partners.

### Inquisition
The Psychic Awakening has dramatically increased heretical and xenos threats. **Massive daemon incursions require expanded Ordo Malleus response**. Crisis conditions have broadened Inquisitorial powers, with Ordo Malleus now assigned jurisdiction over Navigator Houses.

**For Rogue Traders**: The Inquisition can investigate and sanction your activities but also offers partnership opportunities against xenos and heretical threats. Joint operations provide valuable intelligence about frontier threats.

### Rogue Traders
Nearly 100 Rogue Traders summoned to Macragge by Guilliman highlights your critical role in reconnecting isolated Imperial worlds. **Emergency conditions increase operational independence** while creating new frontiers to explore.

**For Rogue Traders**: The Great Rift has created unprecedented opportunities for exploration and profit. Your unique legal authority to operate beyond Imperial borders becomes more valuable than ever in the divided galaxy.

### Navigator Houses (Navis Nobilite)
The only means of reliable long-range Warp travel makes Navigators even more valuable under disrupted conditions. Traditional Houses compete with Shrouded Houses and Renegade Houses for influence. **Current leader Francisco M'edici leads the Paternova authority**.

**For Rogue Traders**: Absolutely critical for any long-range operations. Different Houses offer different services and capabilities. Free Charter Navigators provide complete service autonomy but command premium prices.

## Chaos: The Eternal Enemy

### The Warp
The Immaterium has become far more dangerous post-Great Rift. **Warp storms proliferate across the galaxy** while time flows inconsistently across regions. The Psychic Awakening enhances psychic phenomena and increases psyker numbers. Reality becomes increasingly malleable and responsive to thought and emotion.

**For Rogue Traders**: Warp rifts may reveal previously inaccessible systems but carry extreme daemon risks. Increased psychic activity threatens crew corruption. Proper Gellar Field maintenance becomes literally life-or-death critical.

### Chaos Gods
**Khorne** benefits enormously from galaxy-wide warfare, making him currently the strongest god. **Tzeentch** gains power from the Psychic Awakening and increased sorcery use. **Nurgle** currently weakest but benefits from Great Rift despair. **Slaanesh** exploits desperation and extremes driven by galactic warfare.

**For Rogue Traders**: Each god offers different corruption risks and opportunities. Khornate artifacts provide combat advantages but risk uncontrolled violence. Tzeentchian knowledge comes with mutation risks. Nurglite followers prove extremely resilient but spread plague. Slaaneshi items enhance social skills but lead to depravity.

### The Eye of Terror & Daemon Worlds
The Eye remains the largest stable Warp rift but no longer unique due to new rifts galaxy-wide. **Daemon worlds proliferated significantly following the Great Rift**, each reflecting their ruler's nature and dominant Chaos God influence.

**For Rogue Traders**: These regions offer unique resources impossible to create elsewhere but carry extreme corruption risks. Daemon-forged weapons and forbidden knowledge command astronomical prices among those willing to trade in such materials.

### Black Legion
Under Abaddon's leadership, the Black Legion achieved their greatest victory by destroying Cadia and creating the Great Rift. **Currently prosecuting multiple major campaigns** including the War of Beasts on Vigilus and the Arks of Omen Campaign. They maintain the most numerous and well-equipped Traitor Legion.

**For Rogue Traders**: The primary Chaos threat likely to intercept expeditions. Their raids generate flows of stolen Imperial artifacts into black markets. Information on Black Legion movements proves extremely valuable to Imperial authorities.

### Death Guard & Mortarion
Established the Scourge Stars domain north of Ultramar and launched the Plague Wars against Guilliman's forces. **Mortarion has resumed direct control** after millennia of absence, consolidating territorial gains while spreading plague outbreaks galaxy-wide.

**For Rogue Traders**: Death Guard presence creates profitable quarantine-running opportunities. Medical supplies command premium prices in affected regions. Plague strains prove valuable for research but carry extreme dangers.

### Thousand Sons & Magnus the Red
Successfully relocated their Planet of Sorcerers from the Eye of Terror to orbit above restored Prospero. **Greatly empowered by galaxy-wide psychic awakening**, they conduct major campaigns in the Stygius Sector while performing rituals on their restored homeworld.

**For Rogue Traders**: Possess extensive archives of prohibited lore and powerful warp-touched artifacts. Information about future events might be available through intermediaries, though acquiring such knowledge risks damnation.

## Xenos Factions: Alien Threats and Opportunities

### Orks & Ghazghkull Thraka
**Ghazghkull was killed by Ragnar Blackmane but resurrected by Mad Dok Grotsnik** in a larger, more powerful body. Now commands over 5 million Greenskin warships in "Da Great Waaagh!" His psychic presence draws Orks from light-years away, creating unprecedented unity among the normally fractious species.

**For Rogue Traders**: Small raids can rapidly escalate into massive Waaagh!s. Limited trade opportunities exist for "shiny" technology. Orks make aggressive scavengers, competing for battlefield debris and wrecked ships.

### Tyranids & Hive Fleets
**Current fleets may only be "scouting forces"** with the main invasion still approaching from intergalactic space. The Strategic Collective projects 500% mobilization increase needed within a century. Hive Fleet Leviathan splits into multiple tendrils pushing toward Terra.

**For Rogue Traders**: Absolute existential threat to all organic life. Advance warning of fleet movements provides extremely valuable intelligence. Dead worlds stripped by Tyranids may contain rare minerals exposed by bio-consumption.

### Eldar/Aeldari
**The Ynnari faction formed under prophet Yvraine** seeking to fully awaken Ynnead. They helped resurrect Guilliman, creating unprecedented Imperial alliance. All major Craftworlds dispatch forces across the galaxy to manipulate fate according to their prophecies.

**For Rogue Traders**: May offer alliance against greater threats. Advanced technology potentially available through careful negotiation. Ynnari prove more willing to work with humans than traditional Craftworlds.

### Dark Eldar/Drukhari
**Increased raiding activity exploits opportunities** provided by the Great Rift. Commorragh experiences "Great Dysjunction" with increased civil war between pro- and anti-Ynnari factions. Supreme Overlord Vect opposes the Ynnari movement.

**For Rogue Traders**: Black market trade possible through intermediaries. Information brokerage opportunities—they know much about galactic movements. Raid risks increase as they target prestigious captives.

### Tau Empire
**Fourth Sphere expedition trauma** created uncharacteristically xenophobic survivors, while the Fifth Sphere launches under Commander Shadowsun. Internal tensions exist between pragmatic Fifth Sphere forces and traumatized Fourth Sphere veterans.

**For Rogue Traders**: Most reasonable xenos faction for negotiation and trade. Advanced technology potentially available. Highest trade potential among all xenos factions, especially in pre-Fourth Sphere territories.

### Necrons & The Silent King
**Szarekh returned to the galaxy** after encountering Tyranids in intergalactic space. Massive awakening of Tomb Worlds proceeds across the galaxy. The Silent King seeks to unite dynasties against the Tyranid threat while harvesting blackstone for anti-Warp pylons.

**For Rogue Traders**: Consider all organic life inferior and will exterminate colonies to reclaim worlds. Ancient knowledge of galactic threats might be obtainable. Technology advantage makes direct confrontation suicidal.

## Key Figures: Architects of the 42nd Millennium

### Abaddon the Despoiler
Now titles himself "Warmaster of the Imperium Nihilus" following his 13th Black Crusade success. **Rules over the dark half of the Imperium**, commanding larger territory than Horus ever held. Commands the largest Chaos Space Marine force in existence.

### Roboute Guilliman
**Lord Commander of the Imperium and Imperial Regent**, the de facto ruler in the Emperor's name. Leading the Indomitus Crusade to stabilize territory after the Great Rift. Can issue orders to Rogue Traders and potentially revoke Warrants of Trade.

### Belisarius Cawl
**Prime Conduit of the Omnissiah**, creator of Primaris Marines and key figure in Guilliman's resurrection. Currently working to close the Great Rift using Necron blackstone technology. Possesses vast knowledge accumulated over millennia.

### Yvraine (Daughter of Shades)
**Leader of the Ynnari faction** seeking to unite all Aeldari in service to Ynnead. Actively pursues Croneswords to fully awaken the God of the Dead. May work with pragmatic Rogue Traders against Chaos threats.

### Eldrad Ulthran
**Ancient Farseer of Craftworld Ulthwé**, now allied with the Ynnari despite previous conflicts. Master manipulator capable of seeing potential futures and engineering outcomes across centuries.

### Saint Celestine
**The Imperium's most prominent Living Saint**, recently instrumental in the Fall of Cadia and Guilliman's resurrection. Immortal warrior who can resurrect herself and others, appearing at crucial moments to inspire the faithful.

## Major Events & Locations: Strategic Focal Points

### Fall of Cadia
**Planet destroyed when Abaddon crashed the Blackstone Fortress** into it during the 13th Black Crusade. Loss of Blackstone Pylons allowed Eye of Terror expansion, creating the Great Rift. Approximately 3 million Cadians evacuated to "New Cadia" on Chaeros.

**For Rogue Traders**: Elite Cadian veterans available for recruitment. High demand for military equipment in refugee settlements. Daemon-infested ruins pose extreme risks but may contain valuable artifacts.

### The Great Rift/Cicatrix Maledictum
**Galaxy-spanning Warp storm** stretching from the Eye of Terror to the Eastern Fringe, dividing the Imperium into Sanctus and Nihilus. Only stable passages are the Nachmund Gauntlet and Attilan Gate. Creates temporal distortions where time flows differently.

**For Rogue Traders**: New Warp routes opened on Imperial space fringes. Isolation creates monopoly trading opportunities. Premium pricing for goods crossing the Rift. Massive demand for basic supplies in cut-off systems.

### Blackstone Fortresses
**Planetoid-sized structures built from Noctilith** with anti-Warp properties. Several controlled by Chaos forces. Each contains internal Webway passages and autonomous defensive systems. Can function as reality-tearing superweapons when fully activated.

**For Rogue Traders**: Archeotech salvage opportunities command premium prices. Navigation services to fortress locations prove highly valuable. Any recovered blackstone material has enormous worth.

### Hive Cities
**Self-contained arcologies housing billions** serve as primary manufacturing hubs. Increased importance for war production in the divided Imperium. Resource strain and refugee influxes create security concerns and gang warfare.

**For Rogue Traders**: Consistent demand for food imports and raw materials. Large-scale contracts for manufactured goods export. Recruitment opportunities for specialized workers and gang fighters.

### Forge Worlds
**Planets completely controlled by Tech-Priests** ramped up to maximum production. Resource shortages lead to stripping entire star systems. **Seven major Forge Worlds destroyed** entirely. Increased autonomy due to communication disruption.

**For Rogue Traders**: Exclusive contracts for rare material procurement. Technology trading and archeotech exchange opportunities. Premium pricing for advanced technology and long-term supply contracts.

## Core Concepts: Essential Knowledge for Operations

### Psykers & Psychic Powers
The **Psychic Awakening dramatically increases psyker emergence** in unprecedented numbers. Previously dormant mutations now activate, making anyone potentially psychic. Enhanced powers carry higher corruption and possession risks due to strengthened Warp energies.

**For Rogue Traders**: Essential crew members (Navigators, Astropaths) but require constant monitoring. Regular screening necessary to detect manifestations among existing crew. Emergency response teams must be equipped with blessed weapons.

### Gellar Fields & Warp Travel
**Increased strain from Great Rift effects** makes Warp travel more dangerous with frequent field fluctuations. Field failures now more catastrophic due to increased daemon activity. Multiple redundancies essential for crew survival.

**For Rogue Traders**: Life-or-death technology requiring constant tech-priest oversight. Higher-grade fields provide better protection. Route planning must avoid high-risk Warp areas. Maintain larger inventories of sanctified components.

### Ynnari
**Religious movement seeking to fully awaken Ynnead** to save the Aeldari without species extinction. Now opposed by powerful enemies including Asdrubael Vect. Grey Knights actively purge Ynnari cults as daemonic threats.

**For Rogue Traders**: Unpredictable allies against Chaos but cooperation risks Inquisitorial investigation. May provide Webway navigation assistance and advanced technology. Intelligence on Chaos operations potentially available.

### Genestealer Cults
**Accelerated spread through refugee flows** from Great Rift disasters. Enhanced infiltration exploits chaos and instability. Some cults now operate across multiple star systems rather than single worlds.

**For Rogue Traders**: Large crew populations ideal infection targets. Regular medical screening essential but later generations nearly undetectable. Quarantine protocols necessary for new crew members.

### Waaagh! Culture
**More Waaagh!s than ever recorded** due to galactic instability. Opportunistic expansion exploits Imperial weakness. **Psychic awakening may strengthen Waaagh! fields**. Successful campaigns attract more Orks through exponential growth.

**For Rogue Traders**: Small raids can rapidly escalate into massive threats. Limited trade opportunities exist for technology. Quick escalation protocols necessary as numbers multiply rapidly.
