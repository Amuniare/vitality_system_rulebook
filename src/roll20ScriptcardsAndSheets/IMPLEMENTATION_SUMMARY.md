## What Needs to Be Done (User)

### Step 1: Review Documentation

- [ ] Read `ROLL20_UPDATE_ROADMAP.md` (overview)
- [ ] Read `SCRIPTCARDS_V6_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` (ScriptCards details)
- [ ] Read `TESTING_CHECKLIST_V6.md` (testing plan)

### Step 2: Upload Character Sheet to Roll20

1. Log into Roll20 campaign
2. Go to Game Settings → Character Sheet Template
3. Upload `char_sheet_v6/rpgSheet_v6.0.html`
4. Save and test with new test character

### Step 3: Implement ScriptCards Updates

**Option A: Manual Implementation (Recommended)**
1. Open `SCRIPTCARDS_V6_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`
2. Work through sections 1-7 sequentially
3. Test after each section
4. Estimated time: 4-6 hours implementation + 2-4 hours testing

**Option B: Start Fresh**
1. Copy base file from `scriptcards_v6/Scriptcards_Attacks_Library_v6.0.txt`
2. Implement all changes at once
3. Test comprehensively
4. Estimated time: 6-8 hours total

### Step 4: Test Everything

1. Open `TESTING_CHECKLIST_V6.md`
2. Create test character (do NOT use existing v5.5 character)
3. Work through all 9 testing phases
4. Document any issues found
5. Estimated time: 4-6 hours

### Step 5: Migrate Existing Characters (Optional)

1. Follow migration notes in `ROLL20_UPDATE_ROADMAP.md`

## Known Limitations

### What Roll20 CANNOT Do:

1. **Point Cost Calculations** - Must track manually
2. **Archetype Selection** - Must select manually
3. **Complex Limit Tracking** - Many limits require GM manual verification
4. **Condition Choices** - Brawl requires manual choice of Push/Prone/Grab
5. **AOE Target Selection** - Precise upgrade requires manual targeting
6. **Combo/Chain Enforcement** - Barrage/Extra Attack honor system

### What Roll20 CAN Do:

1. ✅ **Stat Calculations** - All derived stats auto-calculate
2. ✅ **Attack Resolution** - Dice rolls, bonuses, comparisons
3. ✅ **Status Markers** - Apply/remove markers for conditions
4. ✅ **Damage Application** - Auto-apply damage to HP bars
5. ✅ **Simple Conditionals** - HP thresholds, random rolls
6. ✅ **Notes & Reminders** - Display limit requirements, upgrade effects

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Character Sheet Not Loading

**Solution:**
- Verify HTML file uploaded correctly
- Check Roll20 Game Settings → Character Sheet Template
- Try refreshing browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R)

### Issue: Stats Calculating Incorrectly

**Solution:**
- Verify using NEW test character (not migrated v5.5)
- Check attribute names match sheet worker expectations
- Review sheet worker console (F12 → Console) for errors

### Issue: ScriptCards Not Working

**Solution:**
- Verify ScriptCards API script is installed in campaign
- Check API sandbox console for errors
- Verify character sheet attribute names match ScriptCards references
- Test with simple attack first (Type 0, no upgrades)

### Issue: Conditions Not Applying

**Solution:**
- Verify condition dropdown value matches ScriptCards EffectType codes (0-7)
- Check Roll20 status marker permissions
- Verify LibSN (Status Number library) is loaded

### Issue: Limits Not Triggering

**Solution:**
- Verify limit field values are set to 1 (not 0)
- Check HP thresholds for HP-based limits
- Review ScriptCards output for limit notes
- Remember many limits require manual GM verification
