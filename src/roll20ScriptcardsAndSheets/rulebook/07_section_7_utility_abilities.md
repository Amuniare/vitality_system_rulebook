# SECTION 7: UTILITY ABILITIES

These abilities represent your character's capabilities outside of combat. 

**Point Pools**
- Utility Points: 5 × (Tier) points
- Can be spend on Features, Senses, Movement Abilites, or Descriptors


## Features

Abilities that enable entirely new categories of actions and checks impossible through standard character capabilities. Features grant access to supernatural effects, reality manipulation, or fundamentally new interaction methods with the game world.

**Core Principle:** Features allow you to make checks you normally couldn't make. They create new possibilities rather than enhancing existing ones.

**Cost Structure:** 1, 3, 5, or 10 utility points based on mechanical impact and scope of new capabilities enabled.


Here are the features organized alphabetically within their point categories:

### **1 Point Features**

**Aquatic**
Swim at full speed in any aquatic environment. You are unaffected by water temperature, pressure, or current when swimming.

### **3 Point Features**

**Ancestral Knowledge**
You can communicate with ancestral spirits for guidance.

**Assistant**

**Auratic Sway**
Emits a subtle aura that affects emotions or moods in the immediate vicinity. You can make an Intimidation or Communication check against everyone nearby to slightly alter their mood or emotions.

**Distinguished Background**
Your distinct heritage, noble birth, or foreign origin marks you as notable wherever you go. This grants you respect and curiosity that can open doors to influential individuals, exclusive events, and valuable information. However, it also makes you memorable and may create unwanted attention or suspicion depending on local politics and attitudes.

**Dreamwalker**
You can enter and interact with dreams.

**Elastic Movement**
Stretch your limbs to reach distant objects or compress your body to fit through spaces one-quarter your normal size automatically.

**Fall Proof**
Completely negate fall damage from any height automatically.

**Familiar**
You have a small-sized creature or construct that obeys your commands. You can see through its senses and control its movement. It uses your skills for any checks; if it's a creature, it uses your Awareness instead of Mobility. It cannot take actions other than skill checks. It has 0 in all combat stats, and if it takes damage, it is destroyed and cannot be resummoned until after a full rest. The familiar can scout dangerous areas, retrieve objects, or act as a distraction.

**Forbiddance**
Once per rest, over the course of an hour, you may create a ward that protects up to a 100 by 100 space area from observation, teleportation, and communication through the barrier. Choose one category of being (work with GM to define). Chosen creatures take (10 + Focus or Power) damage per turn spent in the area. The ward lasts one day. If you use this feature every day for 100 days in the same spot, the effect becomes permanent.

**Glyph of Warding**
It takes one hour to set up the trap, and you may set it to release one of your special attacks. The glyph may not be moved from where it was set up. You can have a number of active traps equal to your Intelligence score. If the trap is triggered, the attack is released. You suffer/are limited by your limits when setting the trap. Hidden traps require an Awareness or Intelligence check against double your Intelligence to detect.

**Jury Rigging**
You can repair or modify the function of any item or object without using materials. However, the repair is temporary and will break again at the end of the session or after intense use. The quality and duration of your repair is based on an Intelligence check determined by the GM.

**Light Sleeper**
You do not require sleep and are passively aware of your surroundings even while resting. Your Awareness checks are not reduced while resting, and you can remain alert during the party's rest periods. You still require the same rest duration to recover HP, Efforts, and ability uses.

**Master Sculptor**
Choose a specific material (stone, metal, wood, clay, etc.). You can precisely shape, mold, or alter that material at rapid pace, working on up to 8 cubic meters per minute. This allows you to create tools, artistic works, or modify existing structures made of your chosen material without requiring traditional crafting tools.

**Material Shaping**
You can temporarily transform mundane materials and objects into different forms. Convert one material into another similar material, or reshape an object into a different object of similar size and density. You cannot create complex mechanical devices or change the fundamental properties of materials (turning wood into metal, etc.).

**Mystic Guardian**
You can create temporary magical guardians or constructs that can complete simple tasks. These guardians can act as watchmen, couriers, or assistants in problem-solving tasks.

**Object Encryption**
You can seal items in a protective field to prevent tampering.

**Prodigy**
After 4 hour of focused study, gain Tier bonus to checks involving that specific topic until next rest.

**Prophet**
You receive visions of a future that may or may not happen. Once per session, you may attempt to force one of these visions. Roll a d100; the higher the number, the more accurate and less vague the vision becomes.

**Psychic Link**

**Psychometry**
You can perceive the recent history and emotional imprints of objects through touch.

**Spiritual Bind**
You can temporarily bind yourself to an object or location, granting limited influence, observation, or protection.

**Sponsor**
Someone has invested a great deal of time and/or money to get you where you are. You have greater access to resources, and they are inclined to protect their investment. However, you are beholden to them, and they might cut their losses if things get too dicey.

**Stealth Guidance**
You can add your Awareness score to the Stealth checks of any allies within 3 spaces of you that you designate. This ability helps your team move undetected while you coordinate their movements and watch for threats.

**Street Performer**
You can always find opportunities to earn money and resources through performances, hustling, or social connections. Make a Communication check to acquire money or secure free lodging and meals. The GM determines the difficulty based on the amount needed and local circumstances. Success may involve entertaining crowds, making deals, or leveraging social networks.

### **5 Point Features**

**Alchemist**
You are a master of creating experimental tinctures and tonics. The concoctions work a single time to accomplish a specific goal.

The GM will decide the DCs, the amount of time it takes, and any costs.

**Astral Projection**
While resting, you can travel to other locations using a spectral form. You are visible but intangible while astral projecting, able to move through solid objects and observe your surroundings.

**Hidden Trap**
It takes one hour to set up the trap, and you may set it to release one of your special attacks. You can set a number of traps equal to your Awareness per rest. If the trap is triggered, the attack is released. You suffer/are limited by your limits when setting the trap. Hidden traps require an Awareness check against double your Awareness to detect and a Mobility check to disarm or avoid.

**Immortality**
