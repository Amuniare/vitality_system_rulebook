## SESSION SUMMARY - 2025-05-25 Hybrid Roll20 Character Extraction Implementation

**ATTEMPTED:**
- Hybrid handout + browser automation approach â†’ **Success** (API creates handouts, browser reads them)
- ScriptCards template compression system â†’ **Failed** (spacing/formatting issues prevent template matching)
- Method implementation guidance â†’ **Partial** (code provided but locations were unclear initially)

**KEY FINDINGS:**
- **What worked:** Hybrid approach is much faster and more reliable than individual character extraction (8 handouts vs 188 character sheets)
- **What didn't work:** ScriptCards template compression failed due to formatting/whitespace differences between template and actual content
- **Important discoveries:** JSON extraction from handouts works perfectly; abilities are already in JSON format; template matching needs better normalization

**CURRENT STATE:**
- Working hybrid extraction system that successfully reads all 188 characters from 8 handouts
- Complete character data extraction including attributes, repeating sections, and abilities
- Template compression system designed but not functional due to formatting issues
- Handouts remain in Roll20 journal after extraction (need cleanup)

**NEXT STEPS:**
1. Fix ScriptCards template compression by improving whitespace/formatting normalization
2. Add handout cleanup functionality (`!handout-cleanup` command after extraction)
3. Test template compression with better string normalization
4. Implement optional expanded ability export for debugging template matching

**AVOID:**
- Individual character sheet extraction approaches (too slow for 188 characters)
- Making assumptions about existing methods without verification
- Providing code without complete file locations and implementation instructions
- Complex DOM parsing when JSON data is already available
