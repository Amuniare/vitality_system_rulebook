## SESSION SUMMARY - 2025-05-25 Roll20 Character Extraction Implementation

**ATTEMPTED:**
- Custom Roll20 API Script Development â†’ **Success** (API installed and working, extracting data correctly)
- Python Integration with Custom API â†’ **Failed** (Python not detecting API responses properly)
- Bulk Character Extraction (all 188 at once) â†’ **Failed** (Roll20 chat message limits exceeded)
- Character List Retrieval â†’ **Partial Success** (worked but response too long for proper parsing)

**KEY FINDINGS:**
- **What worked:** Custom Roll20 JavaScript API script successfully extracts complete character data with proper JSON structure
- **What didn't work:** Python chat response detection logic fails to recognize API success messages; Roll20 chat has ~8K character limits making bulk extraction impossible
- **Important discoveries:** 188 characters Ã— full data = potentially 1-10MB of JSON (far exceeds chat limits); Character-by-character processing is the only viable approach within Roll20's constraints

**CURRENT STATE:**
- Roll20 API script (`CharacterExtractor.js`) installed and functioning correctly
- Python extractor code written but needs fixes for response detection and parsing
- Successfully tested: `!extract-test`, `!extract-list`, `!extract-character` commands work
- 188 characters identified and ready for extraction

**NEXT STEPS:**
1. Fix Python response detection (look for correct API response text patterns)
2. Implement proper character-by-character processing loop
3. Add chat archive access if needed for longer responses
4. Test with 2-3 characters first, then scale to full 188
5. Implement resume capability for interrupted extractions

**AVOID:**
- Bulk extraction approaches (exceeds Roll20 chat limits)
- Complex Fetch API or ChatSetAttr parsing methods (overly complicated)
- Processing multiple characters simultaneously (causes chat overflow)
- Relying on DOM extraction as primary method (fragile and slow)
