## SESSION SUMMARY - 2025-05-26 JSON Format & Unicode Fixes

**ATTEMPTED:**
- Unicode encoding fix (replace âœ“ with [OK]) â†’ **Success** (no more encoding errors in logs)
- Template sheet filtering (skip MacroMule/ScriptCards_TemplateMule) â†’ **Partial** (filtering logic added but still processing)
- Compression system cleanup (reduce logging spam) â†’ **Success** (single summary logging implemented)
- New flat JSON format implementation â†’ **Failed** (data structure mismatch causing compression errors)

**KEY FINDINGS:**
- **What worked:** Unicode symbol replacement eliminated the primary blocking error; extraction continues successfully
- **What didn't work:** The abilities compression system expects a dictionary but is receiving a list, causing "'list' object has no attribute 'items'" errors
- **Important discoveries:** The system is now generating the new JSON format (abilities as array), but the compression code still expects the old format (abilities as object/dict); there's a format mismatch between the Roll20 API output and the Python compression code

**CURRENT STATE:**
- Unicode issues resolved - no more encoding crashes
- Extraction continues and completes successfully (25 characters processed)
- New JSON format is being generated by Roll20 API
- Compression system is failing due to data structure mismatch (expects dict, gets list)
- Template sheet filtering logic is in place but needs verification

**NEXT STEPS:**
1. Fix the abilities compression to handle the new array format instead of expecting a dictionary
2. Verify that template sheets are actually being skipped during extraction
3. Test the complete extraction process with the corrected compression logic
4. Validate that the new flat JSON format is working as intended

**AVOID:**
- Trying to change both the JSON format and compression system simultaneously (caused data structure conflicts)
- Assuming the compression system can handle format changes without updates (it expects specific data structures)
- Making changes to the Roll20 API without updating the corresponding Python code to match
