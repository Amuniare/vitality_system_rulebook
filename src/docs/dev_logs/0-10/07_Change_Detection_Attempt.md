## SESSION SUMMARY - 2025-05-26 Phase 2 Change Detection Implementation

**ATTEMPTED:**
- Phase 1 core functionality implementation â†’ **Success** (creation fallback, auto-close, enhanced API commands working)
- Phase 2 change detection system with CharacterDiffer class â†’ **Failed** (complex deep comparison logic implemented but unusable)
- Roll20 API `!get-character-data` command for current state extraction â†’ **Partial** (command works but response parsing fails)
- Enhanced chat interface to capture long API responses â†’ **Failed** (increased from 3 to 50 messages but still corrupted)
- Chat response cleaning with regex to remove Roll20 formatting â†’ **Failed** (Roll20 inserts timestamps/names mid-JSON, breaking structure)
- Unicode handling in logging â†’ **Failed** (introduced encoding errors with special characters)

**KEY FINDINGS:**
- **What worked:** Phase 1 implementations are solid - creation fallback to update, auto-close browser functionality, enhanced error handling and logging all function correctly
- **What didn't work:** Roll20's chat system fundamentally cannot handle large JSON responses - it splits them across multiple messages and inserts chat formatting (timestamps, sender names) in the middle of JSON data, corrupting the structure
- **Important discoveries:** Roll20 API responses can be 100K+ characters, far exceeding chat limits; chat-based data extraction is architecturally flawed for large payloads; the change detection approach via chat is not viable

**CURRENT STATE:**
- Phase 1 complete and functional (creation with fallback, auto-close, enhanced API)
- Phase 2 change detection system exists in code but fails at runtime due to chat parsing issues
- System successfully falls back to full updates when change detection fails
- Multiple parsing errors and encoding issues introduced in failed attempts
- Core update/create functionality still works despite Phase 2 failures

**NEXT STEPS:**
1. Revert Phase 2 changes that introduced errors and instability
2. Consider alternative change detection approaches:
   - Direct browser DOM extraction of current character sheet data
   - File-based comparison (export current state to temp file, compare with template)
   - Metadata-based change detection using timestamps
   - Skip change detection entirely - full updates work fine and are reliable
3. Focus on Phase 3 (macro coloring) as separate project once core is stable

**AVOID:**
- Chat-based extraction of large data sets from Roll20 API (chat formatting corruption makes this impossible)
- Complex regex parsing of Roll20 chat responses spanning multiple messages
- Over-engineering change detection when full updates are fast and reliable
- Unicode characters in log messages that cause Windows encoding errors
- Multi-step parsing of Roll20 API responses through chat interface
