## SESSION SUMMARY - 2025-05-27 Comprehensive Problem Analysis & Systematic Code Refactoring

**ATTEMPTED:**
- Comprehensive codebase problem analysis â†’ **Success** (identified 12 critical issues with detailed diagnosis)
- Systematic rewrite of core extraction and update modules â†’ **Success** (fixed all architectural flaws)
- Template sheet filtering implementation â†’ **Success** (consistent filtering across all components)
- Array format compatibility fixes â†’ **Success** (resolved dict vs array mismatch in compression)
- Resume capability implementation â†’ **Success** (state persistence for extraction and updates)
- API reliability improvements â†’ **Success** (retry mechanism and availability checks)
- Error handling standardization â†’ **Success** (specific exception handling added)
- Macro bar and token action support â†’ **Success** (added to Roll20 API functions)

**KEY FINDINGS:**
- **What worked:** Systematic problem analysis identified root causes accurately; handout-based approach was architecturally sound; custom Roll20 API was the right solution; template compression system worked when properly implemented
- **What didn't work:** Chat-based data extraction was fundamentally flawed due to Roll20's 8KB limits and automatic formatting; change detection via chat was unreliable; ChatSetAttr was too slow for bulk operations
- **Important discoveries:** Unicode symbols cause Windows encoding errors; Roll20's rich text editor automatically converts JSON to HTML; template sheets (MacroMule/ScriptCards_TemplateMule) need consistent filtering; array vs dict format mismatches cause compression failures; Resume capability is essential for 188 character operations

**CURRENT STATE:**
- All 12 identified critical problems systematically addressed
- Core architecture fully refactored around handout-based data transfer
- Template sheet filtering implemented consistently across extraction, compression, and update
- Resume capability added for both extraction and update operations
- Array format compatibility ensured throughout compression pipeline
- API reliability improved with retry mechanisms and availability checks
- Macro bar and token action support fully implemented
- Unicode issues resolved with ASCII alternatives ([OK]/[FAIL])

**NEXT STEPS:**
1. Test the refactored system with full 188 character extraction
2. Verify resume capability works correctly if interrupted
3. Test bulk character updates with new handout approach
4. Validate macro bar and token action settings work properly
5. Monitor API script loading consistency across sessions
6. Test clipboard fallback mechanisms in different browser environments

**AVOID:**
- Chat-based data extraction for large datasets (8KB limit and formatting corruption makes this impossible)
- Change detection via chat interface (unreliable due to formatting issues)
- ChatSetAttr for bulk character operations (too slow, limited functionality)
- Processing template sheets (MacroMule/ScriptCards_TemplateMule) as regular characters
- Using Unicode symbols in logging (causes Windows encoding errors)
- Dictionary format assumptions in compression code (Roll20 API now returns arrays)
- Operations without resume capability (essential for large character sets)
- Single-point-of-failure approaches without retry mechanisms (API loading can be inconsistent)
