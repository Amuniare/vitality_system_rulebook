## SESSION SUMMARY - 2025-05-26 Roll20 Character Update System Implementation

**ATTEMPTED:**
- Enhanced Roll20 API with character update functions â†’ **Success** (API functions written, installed, and working for character/handout detection)
- Python handout creation via browser automation â†’ **Success** (handouts created successfully with proper naming and data)
- Fixed Roll20 API callback requirements for handout reading â†’ **Partial** (callback functions implemented but JSON parsing still fails)
- Template expansion system for compressed abilities â†’ **Failed** (master template not available errors, system needs ScriptCards templates)
- End-to-end character update via API commands â†’ **Failed** (JSON parsing fails due to HTML formatting in handout content)

**KEY FINDINGS:**
- **What worked:** Browser automation successfully creates handouts with correct names and saves them; Roll20 API can find characters and handouts correctly; async callback functions work for handout access
- **What didn't work:** Roll20's Summernote rich text editor automatically converts plain JSON text to HTML with `<p>` tags, breaking JSON parsing; template expansion requires master template that doesn't exist yet
- **Important discoveries:** Handout content preview shows `<p>CHARACTER_DATA_START</p><p>{</p>` instead of plain text, causing JSON.parse() to fail; the core data transfer concept works but HTML formatting is corrupting the JSON

**CURRENT STATE:**
- Roll20 API functions installed and functioning for character/handout operations
- Python handout creation system works but produces HTML-formatted content instead of plain text JSON
- Character update system reaches the JSON parsing stage but fails due to HTML formatting
- Template expansion system exists but lacks master template for ability decompression

**NEXT STEPS:**
1. Fix handout content creation to produce plain text instead of HTML (disable rich text editor or find plain text input method)
2. Alternative: Modify Roll20 API to strip HTML tags from handout content before JSON parsing
3. Either load master ScriptCards template or skip template expansion temporarily for testing
4. Test complete character update workflow once JSON parsing works
5. Implement ability creation and attribute setting once basic update succeeds

**AVOID:**
- Using Summernote rich text editor for JSON data storage (HTML formatting breaks JSON parsing)
- Relying on ChatSetAttr for complex character operations (too slow, limited functionality, Enter key issues)
- Template expansion without proper master template (causes expansion failures)
- Browser automation for individual character updates (handout approach is much faster and more reliable)
