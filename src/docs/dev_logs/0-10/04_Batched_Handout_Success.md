## SESSION SUMMARY - 2025-05-25 Roll20 Character Extraction via Batched Handouts

**ATTEMPTED:**
- Fixed Firebase 10MB limit with reduced batch sizes (50â†’25 chars) â†’ **Success** (all 188 characters extracted across 8 handouts)
- Fixed Blob usage error (replaced with custom UTF-8 byte calculation) â†’ **Success** (no more ReferenceError crashes)
- Fixed Roll20 API callback errors for bio/gmnotes extraction â†’ **Success** (temporarily disabled to avoid crashes)
- Created API commands for handout management (!handout-open, !handout-close, etc.) â†’ **Partial** (commands exist but don't work as expected)
- Python extraction from batched handouts using API commands â†’ **Failed** (handouts don't actually open programmatically)
- Extracted all 188 characters via batched handouts â†’ **Success** (complete JSON data stored properly)

**KEY FINDINGS:**
- **What worked:** Batch size of 25 characters keeps handouts safely under 10MB Firebase limit; all character data was successfully extracted and properly formatted as JSON; Roll20 API script runs without crashes after disabling problematic bio/gmnotes extraction
- **What didn't work:** Roll20's !handout-open API command doesn't actually open handout dialogs programmatically - it only sends chat messages saying it opened them; browser automation still needed for reading handout content; Roll20 API requires callback functions for accessing character bio/gmnotes fields
- **Important discoveries:** 188 characters successfully stored across 8 handouts with sizes ranging from 0.1MB to 3.9MB; extraction data is complete and includes rich character information (stats, abilities, repeating sections); Roll20 API has strict callback requirements for certain character properties; Roll20 API has limitations for UI interaction

**CURRENT STATE:**
- 188 characters successfully extracted and stored in 8 Roll20 handouts (CharacterExtractor_Data_1 through CharacterExtractor_Data_8)
- Each handout contains properly formatted JSON with complete character data (minus bio/gmnotes fields)
- Python can connect to Roll20 and send API commands successfully
- Handout opening via API commands fails - Roll20 API cannot programmatically open handout dialogs
- Character bio/gmnotes extraction disabled due to Roll20 API callback requirements

**NEXT STEPS:**
1. Implement browser automation to navigate to journal and manually open each handout
2. Extract content from handout textareas using DOM selectors
3. Combine all 8 handout JSON files into complete character database
4. Alternative: Enhance Roll20 API script to return handout contents directly via chat (if size permits)
5. Optional: Implement proper callback handling for bio/gmnotes extraction if needed
6. Clean up handouts using !handout-cleanup once data is extracted

**AVOID:**
- Using !handout-open API commands for programmatic handout access (Roll20 API limitation)
- Relying on Roll20 API to trigger UI interactions (handout dialogs, journal navigation)
- Synchronous .get() calls for character bio, notes, defaulttoken, or gmnotes (requires callbacks)
- Batch sizes over 25 characters (risk hitting Firebase 10MB limit again)
- Using Blob for size calculations in Roll20 server environment (not available)
- Complex handout management through API commands (browser automation more reliable)
