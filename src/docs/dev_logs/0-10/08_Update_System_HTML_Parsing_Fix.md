## SESSION SUMMARY - 2025-05-26 Roll20 Character Update System HTML Formatting Fix

**ATTEMPTED:**
- Direct JavaScript content injection to bypass rich text editor â†’ **Failed** (JavaScript syntax errors with illegal return statements)
- Clipboard-based content transfer to avoid HTML formatting â†’ **Partial** (content transferred but still HTML formatted by Roll20 editor)
- HTML tag stripping in Roll20 API before JSON parsing â†’ **Success** (fixed core parsing issue)
- ScriptCards template integration with placeholder replacement â†’ **Success** (template loaded and abilities expanded correctly)
- Enhanced handout cleanup for update workflows â†’ **Success** (proper cleanup implemented)

**KEY FINDINGS:**
- **What worked:** Modifying Roll20 API to strip HTML tags (`<p>`, `&nbsp;`, `<br>`, etc.) before JSON parsing solved the core issue; ScriptCards template loading and expansion works correctly; clipboard-based content transfer is reliable for data input
- **What didn't work:** Trying to prevent HTML formatting at input level is impossible - Roll20's rich text editor ALWAYS converts plain text to HTML regardless of input method (typing, clipboard, JavaScript injection)
- **Important discoveries:** Root cause was Roll20's editor behavior, not input method; HTML cleaning must happen on API side, not browser side; JavaScript code needs proper function wrapping to avoid syntax errors; Roll20 editor converts all content to HTML automatically

**CURRENT STATE:**
- Character update system fully functional with HTML formatting issues resolved
- ScriptCards template (26,039 characters) successfully loaded and integrated
- Handout creation uses clipboard method with proper fallback mechanisms
- Roll20 API properly strips HTML tags and parses JSON character data
- Cleanup workflows implemented for update handouts
- Template expansion working for compressed abilities

**NEXT STEPS:**
1. Implement macro bar and token action settings during character updates
2. Add character difference detection to only update changed characters
3. Improve creation workflow to switch to update mode if character already exists
4. Add macro bar color coding functionality
5. Close browser automatically at process completion instead of waiting for user input
6. Extract and properly handle macro bar/token action flags during extraction

**AVOID:**
- Trying to prevent HTML formatting at the browser/input level (Roll20 editor will always HTML-format content)
- Using unscoped JavaScript code without proper function wrapping (causes "Illegal return statement" errors)
- Relying on direct DOM content setting to bypass rich text editor (Roll20's editor processes all content)
- Complex browser automation for handout content when API-side HTML stripping is simpler and more reliable
