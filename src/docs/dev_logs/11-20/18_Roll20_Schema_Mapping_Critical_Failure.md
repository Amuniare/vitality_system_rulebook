# Phase 18: Roll20 Schema Mapping Critical Failure

**Date:** 2025-06-19
**Status:** ‚ùå Failed
**Objective:** Implement complete Roll20 specification with proper calculated stats and field mapping to achieve 55+ functional fields for character uploads.

---

## 1. Problem Analysis

The Roll20 schema system appeared to successfully generate 109+ fields during testing, but in production the system was not applying any transformations to web builder data. Instead of converting characters from web builder format to Roll20 format, the system was simply moving files from the downloads directory without any processing.

### Root Cause

The conversion pipeline has a critical disconnect between the schema mapping logic and the actual file processing workflow. While the `SchemaMapper` class was successfully updated to fix field naming patterns and calculate proper stats, the main processing system (`process-downloads` command) is bypassing the conversion entirely and just moving files.

The test showed successful conversion (109 fields, all calculated stats working), but this was using the mapper directly rather than the full production pipeline that processes downloaded characters.

## 2. Solution Implemented

Attempted to fix the Roll20 schema mapping system by implementing proper field naming patterns and calculation formulas.

### Key Changes:
* **SchemaMapper._set_stat_fields():** Fixed field naming pattern to use correct abbreviated modifier names (e.g., `char_avMod` instead of `char_avoidanceMod`)
* **SchemaMapper._map_calculated_stats():** Enhanced to include communication and intelligence attributes in calculations
* **Field Pattern Mapping:** Added proper mapping for defense and combat stats with correct 4-field patterns

```python
// BEFORE: Incorrect field naming causing mapping failures
setattr(roll20_char, f'char_{stat_name}Mod', "0")

// AFTER: Correct abbreviated field names matching Roll20 schema
modifier_mapping = {
    'avoidance': 'av', 'durability': 'dr', 'resolve': 'rs',
    'stability': 'sb', 'vitality': 'vt', 'accuracy': 'ac',
    'damage': 'dg', 'conditions': 'cn'
}
modifier_suffix = modifier_mapping.get(stat_name, stat_name)
setattr(roll20_char, f'char_{modifier_suffix}Mod', "0")
```

## 3. Architectural Impact & Lessons Learned

* **Impact:** The changes fixed the schema mapping logic but revealed a deeper architectural issue where the production workflow bypasses the conversion system entirely.

* **Lessons:** Testing individual components (like SchemaMapper) can show success while the full system pipeline remains broken. Integration testing is critical for validation.

* **Critical Gap:** The file processing workflow needs to be examined to ensure it actually calls the schema conversion system rather than just moving files around.

## 4. Files Modified

* `src/backend/character/schema/schema_mapper.py` - Fixed field mapping patterns
* `test_conversion.py` - Created temporary test (later removed)

## 5. Next Steps Required

1. **Investigate File Processing Pipeline:** Examine `process-downloads` command and related workflow
2. **Fix Integration Gap:** Ensure downloaded files are actually processed through SchemaMapper
3. **End-to-End Testing:** Test complete workflow from download to Roll20 upload
4. **Validation:** Verify that processed files in production match the 109-field test results
