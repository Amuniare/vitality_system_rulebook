---

## Phase 3: Combat Simulation Loop âœ“ COMPLETE

### Implementation Details

**Files Modified:**
- [src/simulation.pyx](src/simulation.pyx) - Complete combat simulation system with parallel processing

**Key Features Implemented:**

1. **Combat State Tracking**
   - Turn-by-turn combat simulation
   - HP tracking for attacker and defender
   - Bleed stack accumulation and decay
   - Victory/timeout detection

2. **Advanced Combat Mechanics**
   - Natural 20 always hits, Natural 1 always misses
   - Bleed damage application and decay (halves each turn)
   - Culling Strike bonus against bloodied enemies (â‰¤50% HP)
   - Finishing Blow bonuses against low HP enemies (â‰¤25% HP)
   - Armor piercing calculations

3. **Parallel Simulation with `prange`**
   - True multi-core processing (releases GIL)
   - Dynamic memory allocation for any number of simulations
   - 8 threads by default (configurable)
   - Automatic result aggregation

**Python API:**
```python
# Single combat
simulate_combat(attacker_dict, defender_dict, attack_dict, max_turns=100, enemy_hp=100)

# Batch simulations (parallel)
simulate_many_combats(attacker_dict, defender_dict, attack_dict,
                     num_simulations, max_turns=100, enemy_hp=100, num_threads=8)

# Statistics
simulate_combat_stats(attacker_dict, defender_dict, attack_dict,
                     num_simulations=1000, max_turns=100, enemy_hp=100)
```

## Phase 4: Attack Scoring System âœ“ COMPLETE

### Implementation Details

**Files Modified:**
- [src/scoring.pyx](src/scoring.pyx) - Complete tactical scoring system

**Key Features Implemented:**

1. **Attack Characteristics Struct**
   - Pre-computed attack properties for fast scoring
   - Attack type flags (AOE, direct damage, melee, ranged)
   - Upgrade flags (power attack, accurate, armor piercing, etc.)
   - Calculated bonuses (accuracy, damage, multi-target, single-target)

2. **Intelligent Scoring Logic**
   - **Multi-target optimization**: Strongly prefers AOE against 5+ enemies
   - **Accuracy vs damage trade-off**: Adapts to enemy avoidance
   - **Armor piercing value**: Detects high durability enemies
   - **Bleed effectiveness**: Favors bleed against high HP enemies
   - **Finishing blow timing**: Scores high against wounded enemies
   - **Culling strike synergy**: Rewards against bloodied targets
   - **Direct damage reliability**: Values auto-hit vs high avoidance

3. **Fast C Implementation**
   - All scoring logic in pure C with `noexcept nogil`
   - Bit flag checks for instant upgrade detection
   - Pre-computed characteristics to avoid recalculation
   - Float-based scoring for fine-grained decisions

**Python API:**
```python
# Score single attack
score_attack_py(attack_dict, situation_dict)

# Compare two attacks
compare_attacks(attack1_dict, attack2_dict, situation_dict)

# Score and rank multiple attacks
score_many_attacks(attacks_list, situation_dict)
```

**Situation Dict Format:**
```python
{
    'num_enemies_alive': int,           # Number of living enemies
    'avg_enemy_hp_percent': float,      # 0.0-1.0
    'num_wounded_enemies': int,         # Below 50% HP
    'enemy_has_high_avoidance': 0/1,   # Boolean flag
    'enemy_has_high_durability': 0/1   # Boolean flag
}
```

### Performance Results

**Benchmark Results:**
- **1.85M+ attack scorings per second**
- Instant tactical decision making
- Correct situational preferences verified

**Scoring Intelligence Validated:**
- âœ“ Single-target preferred for 1 enemy (Power Attack: 11, AOE: 6)
- âœ“ AOE preferred for 5 enemies (Power Attack: -44, AOE: 106)
- âœ“ Finishing Blow preferred for wounded (Bleed: 5, Finishing: 95)
- âœ“ Accurate Attack preferred for high avoidance (Power: -5, Accurate: 15)

**Test Coverage:**
- 7 unit tests, all passing
- Single vs multi-target preference
- Finishing blow vs wounded enemies
- Accuracy vs high avoidance
- Bleed vs high HP enemies
- Attack comparison functionality
- Multi-attack ranking
