Looking at your console logs and the three issues you're experiencing, I can see a clear pattern pointing to a fundamental state management and component lifecycle problem. Let me break this down:

## Root Cause Analysis

The core issue is **inconsistent state propagation and component initialization**. Here's what's happening:

1. **The "p is undefined" error** occurs because `PurchaseCard` is trying to access state data that hasn't been properly passed or initialized when the component re-renders after a state change.

2. **Buttons not working in attributes tab** suggests event listeners aren't being properly attached or are being lost during re-renders.

3. **Needing to change tabs for updates** indicates that components aren't properly subscribing to state changes or aren't re-rendering when they should.

## Detailed Explanation

Your application appears to have a multi-layered architecture:
- **StateManager** (central state)
- **EventBus** (event system)
- **CharacterManager** (persistence layer)
- **Various Tab Components** (UI layers)

The problem is that these layers aren't properly synchronized. When a state change occurs:

1. StateManager dispatches an action
2. CharacterManager saves data
3. Multiple events fire (CHARACTER_CHANGED, ENTITY_PURCHASED)
4. Components try to re-render but don't have access to updated state
5. Components recreate themselves but lose context (event listeners, state references)

The error trace shows that when `MainPoolTab` re-renders after a purchase, it creates new `PurchaseCard` instances, but these cards don't have proper access to the character's purchase data (hence "p is undefined").

## How to Avoid This in the Future

1. **Single Source of Truth**: Ensure components always read from the same, centralized state
2. **Proper Data Flow**: State should flow downward through props, not be accessed globally
3. **Lifecycle Management**: Components should properly handle mounting, updating, and unmounting
4. **Event Delegation**: Use stable event delegation patterns instead of re-attaching listeners

## Systemic Solutions

### 1. **Implement Proper State-to-Component Binding**
- Components should receive their data through a consistent props system
- Each component should declare what state it needs
- State updates should automatically trigger re-renders with fresh data

### 2. **Fix the Component Lifecycle**
- Separate component initialization from rendering
- Ensure event listeners are attached once during mount, not on every render
- Use event delegation on parent containers rather than individual elements

### 3. **Implement a Proper Render Pipeline**
```
State Change → Update Store → Notify Subscribers → Update Props → Re-render Components
```
Each step should be atomic and complete before the next begins.

### 4. **Create a Component Base Class**
- Standardize how components subscribe to state
- Ensure consistent lifecycle methods (init, render, destroy)
- Automatic cleanup of event listeners and subscriptions

### 5. **Refactor Event System**
- Reduce event proliferation (CHARACTER_CHANGED and ENTITY_PURCHASED are redundant)
- Ensure events carry necessary data so components don't need to fetch it
- Make event subscriptions declarative

### 6. **Implement Proper Data Passing**
- When creating components like PurchaseCard, pass all necessary data as parameters
- Don't rely on components fetching their own data during render
- Ensure parent components have complete data before creating children

### 7. **Add State Validation**
- Before rendering, validate that required data exists
- Provide sensible defaults for missing data
- Add development-mode warnings for missing required props

The key is to move from an event-driven, loosely-coupled system to a more predictable, unidirectional data flow where state changes propagate cleanly through the component tree, and components are fully initialized with their required data before they attempt to render or attach event listeners.
