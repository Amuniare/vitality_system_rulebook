## CAMPAIGN OVERVIEW & THEMES

**Core Themes:**
- **Tolerance**: Challenging Imperial orthodoxy by finding cooperation with those the Imperium teaches you to hate and fear
- **Responsibility**: Bearing the heavy burden of command decisions that affect millions across worlds and generations  
- **Discovery**: Pushing beyond accepted boundaries to uncover dangerous truths and forbidden knowledge

**Campaign Tone:** Power fantasy set in classic grimdark - you are exceptional individuals with real agency to shape the galaxy, but every victory comes at a cost and corruption lurks in every shadow.

## BACKGROUND & MANDATE

**Dame Venecia of House Delatorae**  
*Daughter of Venecian Delatorae, Protector of the Lost City of Venece, Guardian of Cadia, Knight Errant of the Imperium, Champion of the 12th Black Crusade, Slayer of Demons, The Armless Terror, The Mad Rogue Trader*

Ten years ago during the 13th Black Crusade, Dame Venecia piloted her Imperial Knight into the Warp to save a High Lord's son. She returned grievously wounded (missing arms, hair whitened, eyes now a vibrant purple rather than typical Cadian coloring) but successful. The Inquisition branded her suspect for surviving Warp exposure. To protect her from execution while keeping her away from Terra, the grateful High Lord granted her a warrant of trade, making her a rogue trader.

**Current Status:** A decade of dangerous operations have built her reputation - she rescued stranded Imperial Guard from daemon worlds, cleansed corrupted shrine worlds, and made controversial deals with xenos to recover Imperial prisoners. Not well tolerated by the Inquisition, but grudgingly respected by those who know her deeds.

**The Warrant of Trade Mandate (999.M41):**  
When Roboute Guilliman summoned hundreds of Rogue Traders to Terra, he tasked them with establishing supply lines and resource acquisition in regions too dangerous for normal Imperial forces. 

- **Supply Line Establishment**: Establish and maintain supply lines for Crusade forces in regions too dangerous for standard Imperial logistics, with particular focus on recovering Imperial assets from Warp-corrupted or lost territories
- **Asset Recovery & Cleansing**: Cleanse corruption where possible and salvage what can be saved when cleansing fails. Establish trade routes and discover new trade routes in reclaimed territories
- **Technology Acquisition**: Maintain trading rights with Adeptus Mechanicus for Warp-resistant tech and acquire any artifacts that can help the psykers of the Empire, with priority for battlefield technologies urgently needed by Crusade forces
- **Military Recruitment**: Authority to recruit from units that survived Warp exposure and employ unsanctioned psykers, but must serve as executor for final wishes of any Space Marines encountered in Warp-touched regions. Establish garrison forces for reclaimed territories
