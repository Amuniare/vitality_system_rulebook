## THE LONG DECLINE (990-995.M41)

### **990.M41 - The Macharian Crusade Ends**
The largest Imperial military campaign in millennia concludes with the conquest of nearly 1,000 worlds. However, the crusade's leader Lord Solar Macharius dies, and his generals immediately begin fighting each other for control. The "Macharian Heresy" civil war divides the newly conquered territories and wastes the crusade's gains.

### **991.M41 - The Badab War**
Several Space Marine chapters rebel against Imperial taxation and oversight. The resulting war between loyalist and rebel Space Marines devastates multiple star systems and sets dangerous precedents for future conflicts.

### **992.M41 - Waaagh! Ghazkull Begins**
The largest Ork invasion in centuries begins as Warlord Ghazghkull Thraka launches a multi-system campaign. Millions of Imperial Guard are deployed to contain the green tide.

### **993.M41 - The Reign of Blood Memories**
As the Imperium struggles with multiple wars, many remember the recent "Reign of Blood" - a century-long period when the insane High Lord Goge Vandire nearly destroyed the Imperium from within. Trust in Imperial leadership remains fragile.

### **994.M41 - Hive Fleet Behemoth Approaches**
Long-range Imperial scouts detect the first Tyranid hive fleet approaching the galaxy. Few understand the true horror that approaches - an alien swarm that devours entire worlds, leaving nothing but barren rock.

### **994.M41 - The Damocles Gulf Campaign**
First major Imperial contact with the Tau Empire (a young, technologically advanced alien civilization). The campaign ends in stalemate, but reveals another rising threat to Imperial expansion.

---

## THE STORM GATHERS (995-999.M41)

### **995.M41 - The Gothic War Ends**
A 12-year campaign against Abaddon the Despoiler's Chaos fleets concludes. Abaddon - the leader of the Black Legion and most powerful Chaos Space Marine warlord - retreats after testing Imperial defenses and gathering intelligence. Imperial forces claim victory, but Abaddon has learned what he needs for his true assault.

### **996.M41 - The First Tyrannic War**
Hive Fleet Behemoth invades the galaxy's eastern rim. The Tyranids - bio-engineered aliens that consume all biomass - devour dozens of worlds before being stopped at terrible cost. The Space Marine Ultramarines chapter suffers devastating losses, including the death of their beloved Captain.

### **997.M41 - The Second War for Armageddon**
Ork Warlord Ghazghkull Thraka invades the hive world Armageddon with the largest Ork force in Imperial history. The war drags on for years, consuming vast Imperial resources and revealing the Imperium's strategic exhaustion.

### **998.M41 - The Octarius War Begins**
The Imperium deliberately starts a war between Tyranids and Orks by guiding Hive Fleet Kraken into Ork territory. Both alien races consume each other in endless battle, but the survivor will be stronger than either was alone.

### **998.M41 - Signs and Portents**
Across the galaxy, psykers (humans with psychic powers) report disturbing visions of coming darkness. Warp storms increase in frequency and violence. The Astronomican - the psychic lighthouse that guides Imperial ships through faster-than-light travel - begins flickering intermittently. Chaos cultists emerge from hiding on hundreds of worlds.

### **998.M41 - The Thirteenth Founding**
A new generation of Space Marine chapters is created to replace losses from constant warfare. However, many of these chapters suffer from genetic instability and mysterious curses, suggesting something is wrong with the Emperor's genetic legacy.

### **999.M41 - The Time of Ending**
Imperial scholars declare this the "Time of Ending" as apocalyptic events multiply across the galaxy. Three more Tyranid hive fleets are detected approaching from different directions. Chaos incursions reach levels unseen since the Horus Heresy 10,000 years ago.

## THE 13TH BLACK CRUSADE (999.M41)

### **Early 999.M41 - The Despoiler's Gambit**
Abaddon the Despoiler launches his 13th and largest Black Crusade from the Eye of Terror - a massive Warp storm where Chaos Space Marines have gathered strength for 10,000 years. Unlike his previous 12 crusades, this one targets Cadia specifically - the fortress world that guards the only stable route from Chaos territory into Imperial space.

### **Mid 999.M41 - The Cadian Gate**
Cadia is the most heavily fortified world in the galaxy, covered in massive fortress-cities and defended by the famous Cadian Shock Troops - the finest soldiers in the Imperial Guard. For generations, every Cadian has trained for this moment. The planet's motto: "Cadia Stands."

### **Mid 999.M41 - First Assaults Repelled**
Initial Chaos assaults are repelled by Cadia's defenders. Daemon armies and traitor Space Marines crash against the planet's void shields and fortress walls. Lord Castellan Creed, Cadia's military commander, coordinates a masterful defense.

### **Late 999.M41 - Imperial Reinforcements**
Space Marine chapters, Imperial Guard regiments, and Imperial Navy fleets rush to reinforce Cadia. The largest Imperial military gathering in centuries assembles in the Cadian system.

### **Late 999.M41 - The Will of Eternity**
Abaddon captures an ancient fortress-ship called the Will of Eternity and uses it to attack Cadia directly from orbit. The planet's void shields begin failing under the massive vessel's assault.

### **Late 999.M41 - Heroes Fall**
Many Imperial champions die defending Cadia. Saint Celestine, a living saint of the Emperor, is killed in battle but later resurrected by divine intervention. Entire Space Marine chapters are wiped out defending key positions.

### **Late 999.M41 - Desperate Measures**
As defeat becomes inevitable, Imperial commanders authorize previously forbidden tactics. Some heroes attempt impossible rescue missions into the Warp itself. Others make deals with xenos races or use forbidden technology.

### **End 999.M41 - The Planet Broke Before the Guard Did**
Facing inevitable defeat, Abaddon crashes the Will of Eternity directly into Cadia's surface. The planet literally breaks apart, its core destabilized. The fortress world that held back Chaos for 10,000 years is destroyed, but the Cadian Guard fight to the last man. Their final message: "Cadia stands... in our hearts."

## THE GREAT RIFT OPENS (000-001.M42)

### **000.M42 - Birth of the Cicatrix Maledictum**
Cadia's destruction creates a massive Warp rift called the Cicatrix Maledictum (Great Rift) that bisects the entire galaxy. This permanent tear in reality stretches from the Eye of Terror to the galaxy's far rim, cutting the Imperium in half.

### **000.M42 - The Noctis Aeterna Begins**
The "Blackness" - a period where the Astronomican fails across huge regions of space. Without the psychic lighthouse, faster-than-light travel becomes nearly impossible. Millions of worlds are isolated and defenseless. Some systems experience centuries of subjective time while others freeze in temporal stasis.

### **000.M42 - Daemon Worlds Multiply**
With the barrier between reality and the Warp permanently weakened, entire planets are consumed by Chaos corruption. Daemons manifest freely across the galaxy. Some worlds are transformed into hellscapes where physics no longer applies.

### **000.M42 - The Imperium Divided**
The galaxy is split into Imperium Sanctus (the "light" side where Terra remains) and Imperium Nihilus (the "dark" side cut off by the Great Rift). Communication between the two halves becomes sporadic at best.

### **001.M42 - The Gathering Storm**
Three major events converge across the galaxy:
- Magnus the Red (traitor Primarch and daemon prince) leads a massive assault on the Space Wolves' homeworld
- The Ynnari (Eldar death cult) begin their plan to awaken Ynnead, their god of death
- Belisarius Cawl (ancient tech-priest) prepares technologies hidden for 10,000 years

### **001.M42 - The Siege of Terra (Second)**
For the first time since the Horus Heresy 10,000 years ago, Chaos forces actually reach Terra itself. The Imperial Palace's outer defenses are breached by daemon armies before the attack is finally repelled.

### **001.M42 - The Primarch Returns**
Roboute Guilliman, Primarch of the Ultramarines and one of the Emperor's surviving loyal sons, is revived from 10,000 years of near-death stasis. His resurrection requires cooperation between Imperial forces and Eldar, creating controversy but hope.

---

## THE INDOMITUS CRUSADE (001-005.M42)

### **001.M42 - The Indomitus Crusade Launches**
Guilliman launches the largest military campaign since the Great Crusade 10,000 years ago. He deploys the Primaris Space Marines - a new generation of enhanced super-soldiers created by Belisarius Cawl using improved versions of the Emperor's genetic templates.

### **001.M42 - The Plague Wars Begin**
Mortarion (traitor Primarch and daemon prince of Nurgle) leads massive plague fleets against Guilliman's home realm of Ultramar. Entire star systems are consumed by supernatural diseases that turn worlds into rotting hellscapes.

### **002.M42 - Primaris Integration**
The new Primaris Marines begin reinforcing existing Space Marine chapters across the galaxy. Some chapters welcome these reinforcements, while others view them with suspicion for their different creation methods and potential loyalty to Guilliman over their own chapter traditions.

### **002.M42 - The War of Beasts**
Massive Ork invasions exploit Imperial weakness. The largest Waaagh! in millennia sweeps across multiple sectors, with some Ork forces actually growing stronger by fighting the enhanced Chaos forces.

### **002.M42 - Chaos Ascendant**
Chaos Space Marine warbands raid freely across Imperial space. Many worlds that survived the initial crisis fall to secondary attacks. The Death Guard spreads Nurgle's plagues, the Thousand Sons corrupt psykers, and the World Eaters slaughter entire populations in Khorne's name.

### **003.M42 - The Vigilus Campaign**
The crucial world of Vigilus becomes a focal point for multiple conflicts as Imperial, Chaos, Ork, and Genestealer Cult forces battle for control of a key strategic position near the Great Rift.

### **003.M42 - The Psychic Awakening**
Psykers across the galaxy experience a dramatic increase in their powers. While this provides new opportunities, it also creates massive dangers as untrained psykers become gateways for daemonic possession.

### **004.M42 - The Devastation of Baal**
Hive Fleet Leviathan attacks the Blood Angels' homeworld of Baal. The planet is saved only by the unexpected arrival of the Great Rift, which destroys most of the Tyranid fleet - but also corrupts the planet's environment.

### **004.M42 - The War in the Rift**
Imperial forces begin establishing footholds within the Great Rift itself, discovering that some regions can be traversed despite the Warp storms. These expeditions face constant daemon attacks and reality distortions.

---

## THE RESOURCE CRISIS ERA (003-010.M42)

### **003.M42 - The Logistical Nightmare**
The Indomitus Crusade's massive scale creates unprecedented supply challenges. Traditional manufacturing worlds are cut off by the Great Rift. Forge Worlds struggle to produce enough equipment for the new Primaris Marines while maintaining existing forces.

### **003.M42 - The Rogue Trader Summons** 
Guilliman calls hundreds of Rogue Traders to Terra, desperate for alternative supply lines. He tasks them with establishing resource acquisition networks in regions too dangerous for normal Imperial forces - including Warp-corrupted territories that others refuse to enter.

### **004.M42 - The Frontier Wars**
Rogue Traders and their fleets begin operations across the galaxy's most dangerous regions. Some succeed in establishing profitable trade routes, while others disappear entirely into the darkness beyond Imperial space.

### **004.M42 - Xenos Alliances**
Out of necessity, some Imperial forces begin making temporary alliances with previously hostile alien races. These controversial partnerships create tensions within the Imperium but provide crucial resources and intelligence.

### **005.M42 - The Silent King Returns**
The Necrons' ultimate leader, the Silent King, returns to the galaxy after 60 million years in exile. His arrival creates new conflicts but also unexpected opportunities as some Necron dynasties prove willing to negotiate rather than simply exterminate all life.

### **005.M42 - The Warp Stabilization Projects**
Tech-priests and Imperial psykers begin developing new technologies to stabilize Warp travel near the Great Rift. These experimental systems are dangerous but necessary for maintaining communication and supply lines.

### **006.M42 - The Tau Expansion**
The Tau Empire launches its Fifth Sphere Expansion, taking advantage of Imperial weakness to conquer new worlds. Their advanced technology and relatively benevolent rule attracts some human populations away from Imperial control.

### **006.M42 - The Genestealer Uprising**
Genestealer Cults - alien parasites that infect human populations over generations - simultaneously revolt on hundreds of worlds. These uprisings reveal that Tyranid infiltration is far more extensive than previously believed.

### **007.M42 - The Dark Imperium Doctrine**
Guilliman officially recognizes the division of the Imperium, establishing separate command structures for Imperium Sanctus and Imperium Nihilus. This controversial decision is necessary but weakens central authority.

### **007.M42 - The Torchbearer Fleets**
Massive supply convoys attempt to cross the Great Rift, carrying Primaris Marines and advanced technology to the isolated regions of Imperium Nihilus. Most fail, but the few that succeed provide crucial reinforcement to beleaguered worlds.

### **008.M42 - The Charadon Campaign**
A massive Imperial offensive attempts to establish a permanent corridor through the Great Rift. The campaign involves millions of troops and hundreds of Space Marine chapters, but faces constant daemon attacks and reality storms.

### **008.M42 - The Rise of the Prophets**
Across the galaxy, charismatic leaders claiming divine inspiration begin gathering followers. Some are genuine Imperial saints, others are Chaos cultists, and many fall somewhere between. These movements destabilize traditional Imperial authority structures.

### **009.M42 - The Tyranid Adaptation**
The surviving Tyranid hive fleets begin showing new adaptations specifically designed to counter Primaris Marines and Imperial technology. The aliens' rapid evolution suggests they are learning from every encounter.

### **009.M42 - The Warding of Baal Secundus**
Imperial psykers successfully create a massive psychic barrier around an entire star system, proving that large-scale Warp manipulation is possible. However, the effort requires enormous sacrifice and may have attracted unwanted attention from the Warp's inhabitants.

*This timeline represents the collapse of the old order and the birth of a new, darker age. The Imperium that survived the Horus Heresy for 10,000 years has finally been broken, divided, and forced to fight for survival on every front. Yet from this darkness, new possibilities emerge—for both salvation and damnation. The choices made in the years following 009.M42 will determine whether humanity endures or falls to the manifold threats surrounding it.*
