Vibrant Retro-Gothic Sci-Fi Style Guide
Inspired by 70s sci-fi matte paintings & Warhammer codex covers

1. Art Style & Technique
    • Traditional illustration feel with inked linework
    • Matte-painted texture with visible brush strokes or grain
    • Vibrant, saturated color palette with stark lighting contrasts
    • Stylized forms over realism: exaggerated silhouettes and heavy ornamentation
    • Composition evokes vintage sci-fi book covers and classic concept art

2. Color Palette
    • Primary Hull: Deep navy blue
    • Secondary Panels/Trim: Crimson red
    • Ornamentation: Bright gold (polished/brassy)
    • Accent Surfaces: Glossy onyx black, radiant white for "divine" areas
    • Lighting: Bright yellow, warm orange, and pink warp-glow reflected on hull
    • Backgrounds: Star-swirled deep void with swirling purples, magentas, and cosmic yellows

3. Ship Design Cues
    • Silhouette: Massive, imposing, and ornate
    • Features:
        ○ Flying buttresses and cathedral towers
        ○ Glowing stained glass windows
        ○ Skull iconography and Imperial eagles
        ○ Gellar-field emitters, sensor vanes, and archaic tech mixed with baroque design
    • Scale cues: Rows of tiny windows, tiny landing bays or statues compared to massive hull plates

4. Phrasing for Prompts
    "Vibrant, richly detailed 70s sci-fi concept art of a massive Rogue Trader starship in deep space. Gothic silhouette with cathedral spires, crimson and gold ornamentation, glowing stained glass, and navy blue hull. Cosmic Warp background in purples and yellow light. Stylized and surreal, matte-painted texture, hand-drawn linework, reminiscent of vintage Warhammer codex art."
