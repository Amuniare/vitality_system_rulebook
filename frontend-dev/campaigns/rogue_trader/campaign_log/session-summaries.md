# Arc 1: Hesperus

### **Session 1: The Silent Scream of Hesperus Relay**

Dame Venecia Delatorae's crew responded to a desperate distress call from Hesperus Prime Relay while salvaging in the treacherous Spectre Nebula. The fragmented message spoke of attacks from a "green moon," a deaf governor, and something called "Seraph's Echo" that must not be awakened. Upon reaching the damaged relay station, they discovered it under siege by approximately 100 agricultural workers from Veridia Secundus, armed with converted farming equipment. Dame Venecia's attempt at diplomatic surrender using her Auratic Sway met with unnatural resistance, while Faust's psychic amplification revealed supernatural forces at work. The battle showcased Brother Rainard's combat prowess and Sister Inés's devastating heavy flamer work, though Vale's inspection of a dying farmer resulted in a dangerous genestealer infection.

The investigation phase revealed each crew member's unique infiltration skills across Hesperus Prime society. Sister Inés's ecclesiastical contacts uncovered religious authorities' deep concerns about lost faith on the outer moons and missing representatives. Faust's underworld connections led him to Tzeentchian chaos cultists in the fighting pits, revealing coordination with the rebellion. Vale's masterful government infiltration recovered critical documents about the postponed "Seraph's Echo" project, while Sagoire's technical expertise at the forge discovered large-scale weapons manufacturing for Thanatos death world. Most critically, Faust's research abilities identified Vale's infection as a genestealer parasite, requiring immediate intervention.

The session concluded with Dame Venecia's leadership during the planetary council meeting, where her assessment of Governor Hax as an "incompetent puppet" proved accurate. Colonel Armitage's honest military briefing revealed the true scope of the rebellion across the agricultural moons and plans to deploy death world soldiers for suppression. Brother Rainard's Space Marine presence had struck immediate terror into the governor, demonstrating the crew's formidable reputation. With Dame Venecia's authorization for intervention secured and the discovery of genestealer infiltration, chaos cult coordination, and the mysterious Seraph's Echo project, the crew prepared for a multi-front war against "The Verdant Kin," while Faust remained behind to maintain his crucial chaos cult infiltration.

### **Session 2: Into the Verdant Kin**

The crew's arrival on Veridia Secundus immediately revealed the horrifying extent of genestealer infiltration through their careful observation skills. Supervisor Coch's eerily perfect worker coordination and the spaceport's 200% productivity increase caught Dame Venecia's tactical eye, while the unnaturally quiet atmosphere unnerved the entire team. At the northern community center, Vale and Sister Inés maintained crucial discipline when encountering advanced hybrid evolution - a woman with pure black eyes and child with ridged forehead awaiting a "harvest festival." Brother Rainard's strategic warning about potential underground escape tunnels proved prescient, while Faust's suggestion of asteroid bombardment revealed the crew's growing understanding of the infection's planetary scale.

Sagoire's technical analysis of building destruction methods and fuel sources provided crucial tactical options for their trap plan, while Brother Rainard's military experience guided the group's strategic thinking about eliminating cult leadership. When the scope of infection became apparent - potentially millions affected - the crew faced a terrible moral choice. Brother Rainard's advocacy for Exterminatus reflected his Space Marine training, while Dame Venecia questioned whether limited action could address such widespread corruption. Faust's successful psychic infiltration of the hive mind using a masterful deception roll (24) allowed the group unprecedented access to genestealer communications and coordination.

The underground infiltration showcased Vale's acrobatic skills as they tested the neo-hybrids' responsiveness, discovering the creatures behaved like mindless zombies under Faust's mental deception. The horrifying discovery of dead Adeptus Mechanicus personnel lined along the tunnel walls vindicated Sagoire's understanding of the technical personnel exodus from the system archives. The session's cliffhanger came when Vale's second acrobatics attempt failed catastrophically, creating noise and suspicious behavior that threatened to expose the entire infiltration just as they reached the heart of the cult's stronghold, with Dame Venecia's supernatural presence beginning to manifest in barely contained rage.

### **Session 3: The Thanatos Assault**

The underground warren erupted into brutal combat that highlighted each crew member's combat specialties. Faust's mind control powers proved devastatingly effective, turning enemies against each other in psychological warfare that demonstrated his growing psychic mastery. However, the psychic assault's spread to party members created a dangerous crisis when Sister Inés fell under enemy control and was forced to attack her allies. Brother Rainard's tactical genius shone as he improvised explosives from mining equipment, systematically eliminating large groups of enemies with calculated precision. Vale's agility and combat expertise complemented the team's ranged capabilities as they fought through hybrids, pure strain genestealers, and the powerful Magus.

The crash landing on Thanatos tested everyone's survival instincts as Brother Rainard and Castor used their power armor's acid immunity to protect the unarmored crew members from the hostile environment. Sagoire's technical knowledge proved invaluable in creating makeshift shelter from shuttle wreckage, while Vale's diplomatic skills established first contact with the psychic Storm clan. When the clan required trials by lightning storm, Castor volunteered first and successfully endured the psychic assault through sheer Space Marine resilience, rolling an impressive 71 total. Dame Venecia's leadership secured increasingly valuable alliances through each successful trial, while Vale's compass technology - created through collaboration with Sagoire - proved crucial for locating the resonance keys.

The final confrontation in the Patriarch's terraforming facility became an epic showcase of coordinated teamwork. Faust's mind control abilities again proved decisive in controlling enemy forces and turning them against each other. Vale's combat prowess earned particular recognition with multiple critical strikes and follow-up attacks, though the battle's intensity pushed everyone to their limits when Vale died and required Faust's time manipulation powers for revival. Sagoire's ranged combat expertise proved decisive against the controlled Patriarch, while Brother Rainard's relentless assault continued even after taking massive damage. Dame Venecia's tactical leadership coordinated the complex battle against multiple high-level enemies while the environment itself posed deadly hazards, ultimately securing victory and advancing all party members to Tier 5.

### **Session 4: The Hesperus Reckoning**

Dame Venecia's masterful infiltration of the Tzeentchian chaos cult showcased her political acumen and supernatural presence. Posing as "Count Venesia," she used her purple-glowing Cadian mutation eyes and references to "Cadia's sky opening up" to convince the cult contact of her chaos allegiance. Her offer of Faust and Cinder as psykers to assist with their daemon transformation ritual set the perfect trap. When the moment came, Faust's exceptional mind control (roll 41) successfully hijacked the ritual's daemon component, while Dame Venecia's Auratic Sway (roll 41) channeled her Imperial Knight's machine spirit through the Warp. The coordinated effort resulted in the simultaneous incineration of thousands of cultists across the city, with Dame Venecia's house horns ringing triumphantly over their greatest victory.

The confrontation with Governor Hax demonstrated Dame Venecia's sharp judgment as she called him "incredibly inept" before his execution revealed the hidden vault. Sagoire's technical expertise proved crucial in analyzing the Dark Age vault's biometric and voice locks, while Brother Rainard and Faust collaborated using psychology and processing power to crack the password system. The vault's contents - massive credits, Harlequin technology, Dark Age workshop tools, and 20 Dark Angel gene-seeds - created complex strategic decisions. Brother Rainard's immediate recognition of the Dark Angel provenance and his warning that the Chapter would "torture some folks" to learn how the gene-seeds were obtained highlighted his deep knowledge of Space Marine politics and the dangerous implications of their discovery.

Dame Venecia's defining character moment came when Inquisitor Vex offered her either sector governorship or continued exploration. Her response - "As long as the Imperium has worlds lost, I will need to be found" - captured her crusading spirit and commitment to Imperial expansion. The massive recruitment campaign showcased each character's influence: Sister Inés's faith inspired religious warriors, Sagoire's craftsmanship created weapons that impressed the Ash Walkers, Brother Rainard's combat trials earned the Bone Hewers' respect, and Vale's diplomatic efforts coordinated the complex negotiations. Faust's loyalty test with the Inquisitor, despite failing when he accidentally called Dame Venecia, demonstrated the deep personal bonds within the crew. The final genestealer assault became a triumphant display of their expanded military might, with each character contributing to the overwhelming victory that secured the Hesperus system and launched their sector-wide crusade.


# Arc 2: Fenris

### **Session 5: The Necron Awakening**

Dame Venecia's quarterly performance reviews during warp travel revealed a crew transformed by their trials, with each member finding their place in her expanding operation. Her discussion with Vale about his death and resurrection experience showed genuine concern for the psychological toll of his enhanced warp sensitivity, while Sister Inés's review touched on her unwavering faith and growing concerns about unsanctioned psykers aboard the ship. Sagoire's brief but positive evaluation highlighted his increasing technical expertise and reliability in critical situations.

The arrival at Fenris system revealed a Space Wolf vessel in orbit around a feral world, with Thrall Captain Magnus reporting a missing pack that had gone planetside for recruitment six hours earlier and lost communication. Dame Venecia offered assistance, leading to planetfall where the crew engaged chaos-corrupted beastmen alongside Governor Ulrich Voss's forces. Voss, a Catachan death world survivor managing the planet's recruitment operations, proved both an effective combatant and valuable guide as Brother Rainard arrived via drop pod to join the battle.

Following Space Wolf tracks through the wilderness and past tamed beastmen settlements, the party discovered the trail leading into a cave system where signs of battle and Space Marine blood painted an ominous picture. Deep underground, they entered an ancient Necron tomb where they found the missing Space Marines under assault by mechanical warriors, Scarabs, and phasing Wraiths. The brutal battle left the crew battered and wounded, with Sister Inés taking serious injuries before managing to heal herself through faith.

Vale's combat skills proved exceptional during the fight, but the awakened Necron forces and their devastating weapons forced a desperate retreat. The crew escaped with the surviving Space Wolves, but were forced to abandon the bodies of the fallen Marines in the ancient tomb complex as they fled the overwhelming mechanical threat.


### Session 6: The Grey Knights Intervention

After escaping the awakening Necron tomb, Dame Venecia's crew learned the true scope of their enemy from Sagoire's extensive knowledge. These 60-million-year-old tomb world inhabitants possess reality-altering weaponry and living metal bodies that make them nearly immortal, awakening in phases to judge whether the galaxy is ripe for conquest. The trek back to Ironhold revealed Dame Venecia's vulnerability as she leaned on Sagoire for support, showing her human side for the first time.

Evening conversations over Governor Voss's aged wine brought unexpected revelations. Faust's time-vision revealed his traumatic birth - cut from his dying mother by gray-armored Space Marines with an Inquisitor present, his homeworld subsequently glassed. Dame Venecia discussed how her ancestral memories create a complex relationship with identity, while other crew members shared their backgrounds. The party then coordinated with the surviving Space Wolves for a return assault on the tomb entrance.

The coordinated attack proved successful through teamwork and Faust's exceptional psychic control, mind-dominating nine Necron Warriors and three Scarab swarms who turned on their former allies. Sister Inés experienced divine intervention when lethal damage was miraculously healed. Vale's temporal scouting revealed the tomb's horrifying interior: surgical chambers dissecting Chaos beastmen, maze-like living architecture, and a continental-scale complex extending deep underground. A mechanical voice taunted about Space Marines making "excellent test subjects," suggesting some Blood Claws might still be alive below.

The session climaxed with the dramatic arrival of Grey Knights - elite daemon hunters operating under direct Imperial authority. Justicar Castor revealed one of the Imperium's most guarded secrets to Dame Venecia: Necron Tesseract technology can permanently imprison daemons, solving their eternal return to the Warp. The Grey Knights seek these devices from the tomb, but sharing this knowledge carries a death sentence for Dame Venecia and everyone she's ever contacted.

The alliance formed around mutual necessity - the Grey Knights will conduct the primary assault while Dame Venecia's crew provides a crucial distraction from another entrance. Both parties understand the likely outcome: the Rogue Trader's forces will probably die, but their sacrifice enables recovery of technology that could transform humanity's war against Chaos. Faust's attempts to manipulate Chaos tribes into fighting Necrons achieved mixed results, clearing one tomb entrance but failing to unite them into a major force.

The crew now has two weeks to eliminate Chaos beastmen across Fenris Tertius while preparing for a coordinated tomb assault that has escalated from local crisis to galactic significance. Dame Venecia's warrant of trade may become the key to humanity's eternal struggle against the forces of the Warp, with the next mission potentially being their last in service to the Golden Throne.

### Session 7: The Grey Knights Alliance


The arrival of the mysterious Grey Knights changed everything. These silver-armored psychic warriors took Dame Venecia aside for a classified briefing that left her visibly shaken. When she returned, the news was grim: the party had two weeks to assault the Necron tomb as a distraction force while the Grey Knights pursued their secret objective. Survival was not expected.

The crew split up to prepare. Faust and Cinder infiltrated chaos werewolf tribes, using psychological manipulation to turn them against the Necrons - though only some tribes took the bait. Sagoire crafted ingenious devices including an EMP disruptor and a gravity cannon for launching space marines into battle. Brother Rainard successfully recruited the surviving Space Wolves, learning disturbing rumors about Grey Knights killing allies to preserve their secrets.

When the tomb assault began, the party's coordination proved exceptional. Vale scouted a trapped corridor filled with Necron defenders, setting up Faust's masterwork: mind controlling nine Necron Warriors and three Scarab Swarms simultaneously. The controlled enemies turned on each other in devastating friendly fire, while the party's regenerating walls consumed the corpses and grew stronger.

Deeper in the tomb, they discovered a Tech-Priest who had been trapped for twenty years, unaware that the Great Rift had torn the galaxy apart. In another chamber, they found the remains of Death Watch Terminators from the Horus Heresy era - Brother Rainard claimed ancient Terminator armor while Faust's visions revealed the tomb had already destroyed an entire Space Marine Chapter and even felled an Imperial Titan.

The climactic battle came in a temporal chamber where a Chronomancer's obelisk slowed time itself. Through desperate innovation, Faust hacked the alien device while Sagoire mastered its technology completely. Their breakthrough allowed them to reset the entire encounter, emerging fully rested and equipped with time manipulation capabilities.

As the session ended, they discovered something that changed everything: a stasis field containing a figure frozen for sixty million years - an Eldar from before the Fall, predating known galactic history.

### **Session 8: The Ancient Awakening**

The crew's discovery of the 60-million-year-old Eldar in stasis proved to be a pivotal moment that would reshape their understanding of galactic history. When Sagoire successfully activated the Necron stasis chamber, they awakened Shaiel Thraezelyn 430, an ancient Farseer who predated the Fall of the Eldar by eons. Taking the shortened name "Alari" to match modern times, she demonstrated reality-warping abilities that surpassed anything the crew had witnessed - teleporting through the webway at will, healing wounds by literally restitching reality, and displaying the lost arts of the Old Ones' children.

Vale's immediate psychic connection with Alari established crucial communication, though her assessment of humanity as "quite violent" species worth potentially saving created tension. Dame Venecia's political instincts immediately recognized both opportunity and danger, privately expressing distrust while acknowledging Alari's usefulness against the Necrons. When Alari offered to teach Vale the ancient webway techniques his people had lost, it became clear this was no ordinary alliance. Her casual demonstration of pre-Fall powers - stepping through webway portals and manipulating space itself - revealed the staggering decline of Eldar civilization since their golden age.

The climactic battle in the tomb's grand pyramid chamber became the crew's most desperate fight yet. Facing a Chronomancer, seventeen Necron Warriors, multiple Doomsday Arks, and a reinforcement-summoning Monolith, the party found themselves outgunned despite their controlled Necron allies. Faust's psychic mastery again proved decisive as he maintained control over multiple enemy units while Sister Inés experienced increasingly powerful divine interventions that worried her companions. The Monolith's ability to summon endless reinforcements turned the battle into a grinding war of attrition that claimed multiple Space Marines and Dame Venecia's loyal servitor.

Alari's combat debut showcased the terrifying potential of pre-Fall Eldar warfare, as she casually teleported across the battlefield while reality bent around her. Sister Inés's growing connection to divine forces manifested in increasingly dramatic ways, leading to concerning questions about supernatural influence versus faith. The battle's intensity pushed everyone to their limits, with Dame Venecia's necron-arm enhancement and floating walls proving crucial for survival against overwhelming odds. The final victory came at enormous cost - their forces reduced to eight controlled Necrons and significantly depleted allies, but they had survived an encounter that could have ended their crusade entirely.

The session concluded with the sobering recognition that while they had gained an incredibly powerful ally in Alari, her ancient knowledge and abilities came with unknown complications. Sister Inés's admission of hearing voices since her resurrection raised new concerns about corruption versus divine guidance, while Dame Venecia's strategic mind continued calculating how to leverage their new Eldar ally against the Grey Knights' inevitable betrayal. With the tomb's greatest threats defeated but their forces severely weakened, the crew faced difficult decisions about trust, power, and the price of survival in humanity's darkest conflicts.

### **Session 9: The Knight's Bond**

Dame Venecia's moment of triumph came when she successfully bonded with the ancient Ceratus-class Imperial Knight discovered in the tomb's depths. Her exceptional communication roll of 49 created an unprecedented mental connection with the war machine's machine spirit, establishing her as rightful pilot and adding devastating firepower to her forces. The bond proved instrumental in the climactic battle against the Shard of the Nightbringer and the Necron Overlord, though the transcriber malfunction meant the full scope of this epic confrontation remained unrecorded.

The crew's emergence from the tomb revealed both victory and tragedy. While they had achieved their impossible mission, the Grey Knights had suffered catastrophic losses - half their elite force eliminated in their parallel assault. Captain Castor's grim report of encountering "hordes and hordes of Necron warriors" with only one recovered Tesseract Labyrinth highlighted the tomb's true deadliness. The Grey Knights' success came at a price that would have broken lesser forces, demonstrating why these daemon hunters operated in absolute secrecy.

Dame Venecia's shrewd negotiation with the surviving Grey Knights secured a crucial political victory. Trading their recovered Tesseract Labyrinth for a recommendation to the Inquisition, she bought her crew freedom from Imperial scrutiny while maintaining the facade of loyal service. The exchange revealed the Grey Knights' pragmatic nature - despite their reputation for killing witnesses, they honored bargains with those who proved useful. Captain Castor's parting words about hoping never to meet again carried the weight of mutual respect between deadly professionals.

Ragnar's revelations about Grey Knight methods cast their earlier alliance in darker perspective. His account of the Grey Knights slaughtering loyal Catachan survivors after a successful joint operation against Chaos forces explained the Space Wolves' hatred for their silver-armored cousins. The conversation highlighted the brutal calculus of Imperial secrecy, where loyal service meant nothing against operational security. Logan Grimnar's intervention had apparently saved Ragnar's life, but the incident left deep scars in Space Wolf memory.

The session concluded with significant strategic planning as Dame Venecia's expanding operation took shape. Ragnar's commitment to rebuilding his chapter using the recovered Dark Angel gene-seeds promised 16 new Space Marines within five years, with exponential growth thereafter. The month spent hunting remaining Chaos tribes with the Imperial Knight served as both practical cleanup and testing ground for the war machine's capabilities. Governor Voss's transformation into a loyal death world commander completed the political restructuring of Fenris Tertius.

The crew's advancement to Tier 6 marked their evolution from ambitious Rogue Traders to sector-shaping powers, with an Imperial Knight, controlled Necron technology, ancient Eldar allies, and a growing Space Marine chapter under their command. Their impressive loot haul - including the Orb of Resurrection, Tachyon Arrows, and Tesla weapon cores - provided both immediate tactical advantages and long-term technological development opportunities. With six months of downtime ahead, the crew faced choices that would define their next phase of expansion across the Koronus Expanse.
