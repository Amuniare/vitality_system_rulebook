# Mutants Campaign Overview

## Setting
**Seattle, 2030** - A world where mutants make up approximately 5% of the population, living in an uneasy balance with baseline humans. The city is currently under martial law following the gala attack that killed Mayor Brenda Calloway.

## Current Crisis State
### Martial Law and Emergency Powers
- Seattle Police Department given emergency powers after mayor's assassination
- City divided into controlled districts with checkpoints
- Emergency mayoral election scheduled for October 22nd, 2030
- District X referendum proceeding despite chaos

### Refugee Crisis
- Massive influx of mutant refugees from neighboring cities implementing harsh anti-mutant laws
- Makeshift camps in parks and abandoned buildings
- Overcrowded shelters and underground safe house networks
- Growing anti-refugee sentiment fueled by resource competition

### Evolution Plague
- Disease spreading rapidly among refugee populations
- 90% fatal to infected mutants, 99% fatal to humans
- Survivors experience dramatic power evolution or new manifestation
- Origins unclear - possibly natural, engineered, or stress-triggered
- Creating justification for quarantine and increased control measures



## Major Factions

### ULMH (Union of Licensed Mutant Heroes)
- Government-sanctioned hero organization controlling mutant licensing
- Leadership vacuum following Apollo's disappearance after gala attack
- Operates Tartarus underwater facility for "rehabilitation" programs
- Two licensing paths: expensive independent or corporate-sponsored

### MLF (Mutant Liberation Front)
- Revolutionary organization fighting for mutant equality and autonomy
- Led by Serena Kleist (Blizzard) in Seattle
- Operates underground network of safe houses and support services
- Unity running as mayoral candidate representing MLF interests

### Corporate Interests
- Khan Corp: Research corporation with ties to government programs
- Vanguard Industries: Military-industrial developing anti-mutant tech
- Altheon Technologies: Biotech conducting secret mutant experiments
- GeneSys Corporation: Social platform secretly harvesting mutant data

### Criminal Organizations
- Smoke Stack's Organization: Drug trafficking using fake vigilante cover
- Janggi's Operation: International smuggling with Override technology
- Aurora Singh's Network: Mutant exploitation through adult entertainment
- Various gangs filling power vacuums in the criminal landscape

### Political Forces
- Emergency election with remaining candidates from multiple factions
- District X Initiative proposing autonomous mutant-governed zone
- City Council divided on emergency powers and mutant policies
- Federal oversight through Governor's Task Force on Mutant Affairs

## Core Themes

### Appearance
The visible divide between mutants who can "pass" as human and those with obvious physical mutations creates internal community tensions and external discrimination patterns.

### Double Life
The strain of maintaining civilian identities while operating as vigilantes, complicated by surveillance, registration requirements, and factional loyalties.

### Mutant Excellence
The impossible standard of being "one of the good ones" that society demands, used as both carrot and stick to control mutant behavior and divide communities.

### The Trolley Problem
Difficult moral choices with no perfect solutions, exemplified by decisions like Lucille's tunnel collapse or Varia's final transformation.

### Systems of Inequality
How institutional power structures perpetuate discrimination through licensing requirements, corporate sponsorship, selective enforcement, and "rehabilitation" programs.

## Override's Lasting Impact

### Technology Infrastructure
- All electronics require "hardening" against Override interference
- Persistent "echo" in systems that can unpredictably disrupt technology
- Forced technological regression of approximately 20 years
- Hybrid mechanical-digital systems now standard for critical infrastructure

### Detection and Control
- Technopathic mutants can sense Override's "presence" like a ghost in the machine
- Specialized equipment designed to counter mutant abilities
- Surveillance systems adapted for mutant detection and monitoring
- Emergency protocols for potential future Override-level events
