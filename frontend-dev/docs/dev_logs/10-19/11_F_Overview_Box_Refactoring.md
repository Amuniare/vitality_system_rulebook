# Phase 11-F: Overview Box Refactoring

## Objective
To create a reusable and more detailed "Overview Box" component for the Main Pool and Utility tabs, summarizing points spent and items purchased.

## Outcome
-   Developed UtilityOverviewSection.js and refactored the display in MainPoolTab.js.
-   The new component shows a breakdown of points spent by category (e.g., Flaws, Traits, Boons).
-   It also lists all purchased items in a clean, unified list with remove buttons.
-   **Result:** Users have a much clearer summary of their purchases at the top of the tab.
