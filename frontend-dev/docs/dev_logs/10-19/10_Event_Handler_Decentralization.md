# Phase 10-E: Event Handler Decentralization

## Objective
To move feature-specific logic out of the central CharacterBuilder.js and into the respective Tab.js components, adhering to the new architectural principles.

## Outcome
-   Refactored CharacterBuilder.js to only contain a top-level event delegation map.
-   Specific handlers (e.g., handlePurchaseFlaw) were moved to their respective feature controllers (e.g., MainPoolTab.js).
-   **Result:** CharacterBuilder.js is now a lean orchestrator, and feature logic is properly encapsulated, making the code easier to navigate and debug.
