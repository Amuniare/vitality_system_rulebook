# Phase 19: Summary Tab Complete Reconstruction (Failed)

## Objective
Attempted a complete, from-scratch rewrite of the Summary Tab to improve its structure and data display.

## Outcome
-   The attempt was unsuccessful. The new component structure introduced more bugs than it solved and failed to correctly integrate with the existing calculateStats and calculatePointPools methods.
-   **Decision:** The rewrite was abandoned. The existing, functional SummaryTab.js was restored. This failure highlighted that incremental improvements would be a more effective strategy for this component.
-   **Result:** No functional change to the application, but a valuable lesson in development strategy.
