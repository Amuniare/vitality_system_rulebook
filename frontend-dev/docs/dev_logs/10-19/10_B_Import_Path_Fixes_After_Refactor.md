# Phase 10-B: Import Path Fixes After Refactor

## Objective
To resolve the numerous broken import paths that resulted from the major architectural restructuring in Phase 10-A.

## Outcome
-   Systematically went through every JavaScript file and updated import statements to reflect the new file locations.
-   Corrected relative paths (e.g., ../../systems/) to ensure all modules could find their dependencies.
-   **Result:** The application is functional again after the refactor, restoring it to a working state.
