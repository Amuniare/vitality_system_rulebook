**Date:** 2025-06-13
**Status:** üîÑ Partially Completed (validation error pending)
**Objective:** Transform situational expertise system from predefined options to custom player-defined talents with 3-expertise limit and editable textboxes.

## Technical Implementation Log: 30A - Situational Expertise System Redesign

**Problem Statement:**
The existing situational expertise system used predefined expertise names from JSON data. The requirement was to allow players to create custom situational expertises with player-defined talent names, limited to 3 total expertises with 3 talents each.

**Architecture Changes Implemented:**

### 30.1 Data Structure Overhaul
- **Updated `VitalityCharacter.js`:** Added `situational: []` array to `utilityPurchases.expertise`
- **Added helper method:** `createSituationalExpertise(attribute, level, talents)` 
- **New data format:**
```javascript
{
  id: "unique_id",
  attribute: "power", 
  level: "basic"|"mastered",
  talents: ["Talent1", "Talent2", "Talent3"],
  purchaseDate: timestamp
}
```

### 30.2 Cost Resolution
- **Fixed discrepancy:** GameConstants had 1/3 points vs JSON had 1/2 points
- **Resolution:** Updated GameConstants to match JSON (Basic: 1p, Mastered: 2p)
- **Updated:** `expertise.json` with `maxCount: 3` and `talentsPerExpertise: 3` metadata

### 30.3 UI Architecture Transformation
**Before:** Predefined cards showing fixed expertise names from JSON
**After:** Attribute-based layout with editable talent textboxes

**Key UI Changes:**
- **ExpertiseSection.js:** Completely rewrote `renderSituationalExpertise()` and `renderAttributeSituationalExpertiseBlock()`
- **Removed:** "New Power Expertise" title text per user request
- **Added:** CSS styling for `.talent-inputs` with gaps between textboxes
- **Maintained:** Original attribute-based card layout (Mobility, Power, etc.)

### 30.4 Event System Implementation
**UtilityTab.js additions:**
- `handleCreateAndPurchaseSituationalExpertise()` - Creates expertise from textbox input
- `handleUpdateSituationalTalent()` - Live updates talent names as user types
- `handlePurchaseSituationalExpertise()` - Upgrades existing expertise to mastered
- `handleRemoveSituationalExpertise()` - Removes with confirmation

**UtilitySystem.js additions:**
- `addSituationalExpertise()`, `updateSituationalTalent()`, `purchaseSituationalExpertise()`, `removeSituationalExpertise()`
- Updated cost calculation to handle new situational expertise format in `calculateUtilityPointsSpent()`

### 30.5 Defensive Programming - Array Initialization
**Problem:** Existing characters didn't have the new `situational` array property
**Solution:** Applied consistent initialization pattern used throughout codebase:
```javascript
if (!character.utilityPurchases.expertise.situational) {
    character.utilityPurchases.expertise.situational = [];
}
```
**Applied in 9 locations:** All access points to situational expertise array

## Current Status & Outstanding Issues

### ‚úÖ Completed Successfully:
1. **Data structure redesign** - Custom talent storage working
2. **UI transformation** - Attribute layout with textboxes implemented  
3. **Event handling** - All CRUD operations functional
4. **CSS compilation** - Talent input styling with gaps applied
5. **Cost resolution** - GameConstants aligned with JSON
6. **Array initialization** - Defensive programming applied

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issue (Unresolved):
**Error:** `Purchase failed: category.basic is undefined`
**Root Cause:** The old `validateUtilityPurchase()` method assumes traditional `{basic: [], mastered: []}` structure but situational expertises use new array format
**Status:** Identified but not fixed per user request
**Impact:** Purchase validation fails, preventing situational expertise creation

### üéØ User Experience Achieved:
- **Visual:** Clean attribute cards with 3 stacked textboxes (no title text)
- **Functional:** Players can type custom talent names with live name updates
- **Limited:** 3-expertise maximum enforced with clear counter display
- **Consistent:** Same card styling and purchase flow as existing system

## Technical Lessons Learned

### 30L1: Data Migration Strategy
When adding new properties to existing character objects, always implement defensive initialization at every access point. The pattern `if (!obj.prop) { obj.prop = []; }` prevents crashes on legacy data.

### 30L2: Event Delegation Architecture
Real-time text input updates (talent names) require careful event handling to avoid losing focus during re-renders. The solution was to update only the display name element rather than full re-render.

### 30L3: Validation System Conflicts
Legacy validation methods may not be compatible with new data structures. When bypassing validation for new systems, ensure all business rules (limits, costs, archetype restrictions) are still enforced in the new code paths.
