## Technical Debug Log: 26A - Hide Number Input Spinners

**Problem Statement:**
The attribute number input fields displayed browser default spinner arrows (up/down controls) which cluttered the interface since users should use the dedicated + and - buttons for attribute changes. The spinners provided redundant functionality and detracted from the clean design aesthetic.

**Initial Hypothesis:**
CSS pseudo-elements and vendor-specific properties could be used to hide the spinner controls across different browsers. The solution would require targeting both WebKit browsers (Chrome, Safari, Edge) and Firefox using their respective CSS properties.

**Investigation & Action (The Staged Approach):**

*   **Action 26A.1 (CSS Enhancement):** In `rulebook/character-builder/assets/css/tabs/_attributes.css`, added CSS rules to hide spinner arrows. Added `-moz-appearance: textfield` for Firefox compatibility and `::-webkit-outer-spin-button, ::-webkit-inner-spin-button` pseudo-elements with `-webkit-appearance: none` for WebKit browsers.
*   **Action 26A.2 (Build Process):** Manually executed the CSS build script to concatenate all partial CSS files into the main `character-builder.css` file, ensuring the new styles are included in the production build.

**Result:**
The spinner arrows are now hidden on all attribute number input fields across all major browsers. The interface maintains its clean appearance while users continue to use the + and - buttons for attribute modifications as intended.

**Conclusion & Lesson Learned:**
Cross-browser CSS compatibility requires vendor-specific prefixes and properties to achieve consistent styling. The modular CSS architecture with the build script allows for organized development while maintaining production performance through file concatenation.
