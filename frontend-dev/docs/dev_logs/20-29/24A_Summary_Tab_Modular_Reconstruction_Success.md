## Technical Debug Log: 24A-001 - Summary Tab Component Architecture Implementation

**Problem Statement:**
The Summary Tab was completely non-functional due to previous failed reconstruction attempts. The monolithic design caused performance issues, re-rendering bugs, and made the tab impossible to maintain or debug. Export functionality was broken and archetype names were displaying as IDs instead of human-readable names.

**Initial Hypothesis:**
The previous attempts failed due to violations of the architectural principles: components were performing their own calculations, there was no clear data flow, and event listeners were creating "ghost listeners" causing multiple action firings. The solution required strict adherence to the "read-only & composable" architecture with one-way data flow.

**Investigation & Action (The Staged Approach):**

*   **Action 24A.1 (Component Creation):** Created 6 new modular display components in `features/summary/components/`: `SummaryHeader.js`, `PointPoolsSummary.js`, `AttributesSummary.js`, `ArchetypesSummary.js`, `SpecialAttacksSummary.js`, `UtilityAbilitiesSummary.js`. Each component follows the "dumb display" pattern and receives data as render() arguments.

*   **Action 24A.2 (Architecture Enforcement):** Implemented Golden Rule #1 - all components are pure display with no calculation logic. Golden Rule #2 - strict one-way data flow from SummaryTab down to child components. Golden Rule #3 - composition over monolith with SummaryTab as composition root.

*   **Action 24A.3 (Export Centralization):** Moved `exportCharacterJSON()` logic from `SummaryTab.js` to new `exportCharacter()` method in `CharacterBuilder.js` to centralize character operations per architectural guidelines.

*   **Action 24A.4 (Complete SummaryTab Rewrite):** Completely rewrote `SummaryTab.js` with proper event listener lifecycle management, removing the old monolithic render function and replacing it with clean component composition.

*   **Action 24A.5 (Export Statement Fix):** Added missing `export` keywords to all component classes to resolve "doesn't provide an export named" SyntaxError.

*   **Action 24A.6 (Layout Improvement):** Modified layout to use two-row grid structure for better visual organization of summary cards.

*   **Action 24A.7 (Data Structure Fix):** Fixed `PointPoolsSummary.js` to correctly handle the `calculatePointPools()` return structure with `totalAvailable`, `totalSpent`, and `remaining` properties instead of expecting flat pool objects.

*   **Action 24A.8 (Attribute Correction):** Corrected core attributes in `AttributesSummary.js` from incorrect list (including "intuition") to proper game attributes: Focus, Mobility, Power, Endurance, Awareness, Communication, Intelligence. Added missing combat stats: Accuracy, Damage, Conditions.

*   **Action 24A.9 (Archetype Name Resolution):** Implemented archetype ID-to-name resolution in `SummaryTab.js` using `gameDataManager.getArchetypes()` to convert stored IDs (like "superJump") to display names (like "Super Jump"). Modified `ArchetypesSummary.js` to receive resolved names instead of raw character data.

**Result:**
Summary Tab is now fully functional with clean modular architecture. All 6 summary cards display correctly with proper data. Export functionality works. Archetype names display as human-readable text instead of IDs. Point pools show correct spent/available/remaining values. Two-row layout provides better visual organization.

**Conclusion & Lesson Learned:**
The key to successful component architecture is strict adherence to data flow principles - components must be "dumb" and receive pre-processed data rather than performing their own lookups. The previous failures occurred because components tried to be "smart" and fetch their own data, violating the one-way data flow principle. This reconstruction demonstrates that following architectural golden rules, even when they seem restrictive, prevents the cascade of bugs that plagued previous attempts.
