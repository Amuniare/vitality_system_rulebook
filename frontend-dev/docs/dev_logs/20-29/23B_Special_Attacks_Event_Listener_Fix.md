## Technical Debug Log: 23B - Special Attacks Event Listener Duplication Fix

**Problem Statement:**
The Special Attacks Tab was experiencing critical event listener issues where clicking buttons like "Create Attack" would fire the action multiple times, and upgrade category headers stopped responding to clicks entirely. This occurred after multiple re-renders of the tab, indicating a stale event listener accumulation problem that was breaking the user experience.

**Initial Hypothesis:**
The root cause was identified as the STALE_EVENT_LISTENERS anti-pattern where event listeners were being re-attached on every render without properly removing old ones. The existing boolean flag `listenersAttached` was insufficient to prevent listener duplication, and the EventManager delegation pattern was creating ghost listeners on the container element.

**Investigation & Action (The Staged Approach):**

*   **Action 23B.1 (Lifecycle Reset):** In `SpecialAttackTab.js`, added `this.listenersAttached = false;` at the beginning of the `render()` method to ensure proper state reset on each render cycle.
*   **Action 23B.2 (Callback Simplification):** Modified `onCharacterUpdate()` method to simply call `this.render()` instead of manually setting `listenersAttached = false`, allowing the render method to handle the full lifecycle.
*   **Action 23B.3 (Cleanup Infrastructure):** Added `this.clickHandler = null;` and `this.containerElement = null;` properties in constructor to store listener references for proper cleanup.
*   **Action 23B.4 (Cleanup Method):** Created `removeEventListeners()` method that properly removes click, change, and input listeners from the stored container element and nullifies all references.
*   **Action 23B.5 (Safe Listener Setup):** Refactored `setupEventListeners()` to call `removeEventListeners()` first, then create a single unified event handler that delegates based on event type and target, storing both the handler and container as class properties.

**Result:**
The solution completely resolved both issues. "Create Attack" button now fires exactly once per click, and upgrade category headers are fully responsive. The event listener lifecycle properly prevents accumulation of ghost listeners through the mandatory cleanup-before-setup pattern.

**Conclusion & Lesson Learned:**
The ultimate root cause was inadequate event listener lifecycle management where cleanup was not properly implemented before re-attachment. The key architectural insight is that any component that re-renders its HTML must implement a full listener lifecycle with explicit cleanup methods. The STALE_EVENT_LISTENERS recipe pattern is now proven effective and should be applied to all tab components to prevent similar issues.
