# Phase 41: Multiple Failures in Special Attack System Fixes

**Date:** 2025-06-17
**Status:** ? Failed
**Objective:** To implement the fixes outlined in docs/spec.md for the Special Attacks tab, including correcting costs for "Direct Area Attack" and "Advanced Conditions", and improving the UI for type selection.

---

## 1. Problem Analysis

The initial implementation of the Special Attack system had several data contract violations and UI flaws as documented in docs/spec.md. The core goal was to fix these issues to align the application with the rulebook.

The primary problems to be addressed were:
1.  "Direct Area Attack" and "Advanced Conditions" were free due to data contract violations.
2.  The UI for selecting attack/effect types was not user-friendly, as it would hide the selection dropdown after one choice was made.

## 2. Root Cause of Failure

The attempt to fix the issues failed due to a flawed execution process, resulting in a cascade of errors that broke the application's ability to load.

*   **Faulty Code Generation:** My generated Python scripts for modifying files were imprecise. They introduced syntax errors into critical files instead of fixing the problems.
*   **Syntax Error in GameConstants.js:** An extra closing brace } was added, which broke the entire JavaScript module loading process.
*   **SyntaxError in AttackBasicsForm.js:** A faulty find-and-replace operation left a stray token, causing another application-breaking syntax error.
*   **Incomplete Logic:** The initial proposed fix for AttackTypeSystem.js did not correctly implement the cost deduction for advanced conditions, meaning even if the syntax was correct, the functional bug would have remained.
*   **Process Failure:** I failed to verify the generated code for correctness before providing it, leading to a frustrating cycle of errors that required multiple interventions just to restore the application's basic functionality. The original bugs remain unresolved.

## 3. Solution Implemented

The "solution" was a series of emergency patches to correct the syntax errors I introduced. The original functional goals were not achieved. The application now loads, but the underlying bugs from the spec are still present.

### Key Changes (Corrective Actions):
*   Overwrote rontend/character-builder/systems/AttackTypeSystem.js to fix a syntax error.
*   Overwrote rontend/character-builder/core/GameConstants.js to remove an extra brace.
*   Overwrote rontend/character-builder/features/special-attacks/components/AttackBasicsForm.js to fix a stray token and correctly implement the UI logic.
*   Corrected the costKey in rontend/character-builder/data/attack_types_definitions.json.

### Learning & Next Steps
This sequence of failures highlights a critical need for more robust code generation and verification on my part.

1.  **Precision is Key:** I must move away from multi-step, find-and-replace logic for complex changes and instead favor complete, verified overwrites of functions or files.
2.  **Verify, Then Propose:** I need to internally validate my proposed code changes more rigorously before presenting them.
3.  **Next Step:** A new, more precise attempt is required to fix the remaining functional bugs (Advanced Condition cost and Direct Area Attack cost) now that the application is stable again.
