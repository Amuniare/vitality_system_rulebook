# Phases 1-5: Foundation, Core Systems, and Integration (Unlogged)

This document summarizes the foundational work completed before detailed, session-by-session logging began. This initial development established the core architecture, data systems, and primary UI components of the character builder.


### Phase 1: Foundation & Core Systems

This phase laid the groundwork for the entire application, focusing on non-visual, architectural components.

*   **External Data System:** The `GameDataManager` was created to handle the asynchronous loading of all game rules from external JSON files. This established the "data-driven" principle of the application. Over 15 JSON files were created in the `data/` directory, externalizing all game logic.
*   **Core Architecture:** Shared utilities were developed to ensure consistency and avoid code duplication. This included the `EventManager` for centralized event delegation, `RenderUtils` for standardized HTML generation, and `UpdateManager` to orchestrate UI updates.
*   **Calculation Engines:** The `calculators/` directory was established to house pure, stateless functions for all game math. This separated complex calculations (Points, Stats, Limits, Combat) from business logic and UI presentation.
*   **Character Data Model:** The `VitalityCharacter.js` class was created as the single source of truth for a character's state, defining the complete data structure from archetypes to special attacks.
*   **CSS Design System:** The initial `character-builder.css` stylesheet was written, establishing the application's color palette, typography, and spacing rules using CSS custom properties.


### Phase 2: Tab Implementation

With the core systems in place, this phase focused on building out the primary UI structure and the most critical user-facing sections.

*   **Tab Navigation:** The main 7-tab navigation system was implemented, creating the basic application flow from "Basic Info" to "Summary".
*   **Key Tab Implementations:**
    *   `BasicInfoTab`: For character name and tier selection.
    *   `ArchetypeTab`: For the 7 critical archetype choices that define a character's build.
    *   `AttributeTab`: For combat and utility attribute point allocation.
    *   `SummaryTab`: For a final overview and export functionality.
*   **Complex Component Scaffolding:** Initial, complex UI components like the `SpecialAttackTab` and `UtilityTab` were stubbed out, ready for more detailed implementation in later phases.


### Phase 3: Main Pool System (Partially Logged)

This phase implemented the "Main Pool", one of the most complex economic systems in the character builder. This work was partially covered in later logs but the core was built here.

*   **Modular Section Design:** The Main Pool tab was designed with its own sub-navigation for Flaws, Traits, Boons, and other purchases.
*   **Flaw & Trait Economics:** The core logic for the flaw/trait system was implemented, where flaws cost points but provide stat bonuses, and traits cost points to provide conditional bonuses.
*   **Component Creation:** The initial versions of `FlawPurchaseSection`, `TraitPurchaseSection`, and `BoonSection` were created.


### Phase 4: Component Architecture

This phase focused on creating reusable, high-level UI components that provide application-wide functionality.

*   **Character Library:** The `CharacterLibrary` was created to manage saving, loading, and deleting characters using browser `localStorage`.
*   **Point Pool Display:** A dedicated `PointPoolDisplay` component was built to provide a real-time, persistent view of the character's available and spent points.
*   **Validation Display:** The initial `ValidationDisplay` component was created to enforce the build order and report errors to the user, ensuring a valid character creation flow.


### Phase 5: System Integration

This final foundational phase focused on wiring all the newly created parts together into a cohesive application.

*   **Unified Data Flow:** A clear data flow was established: `GameDataManager` loads data, which is consumed by `Systems`, processed by `Calculators`, and finally displayed by `UI Components`.
*   **Event Handling Integration:** The `EventManager` was fully integrated, with parent tabs handling delegated events from their child components using `data-action` attributes.
*   **Update Management:** The `UpdateManager` was put in place to handle the character update lifecycle, ensuring that changes made in one part of the application correctly trigger re-renders in dependent components.
