# Phase 6: SpecialAttack Event Handling Fix *(December 7, 2025)*
**Problem**: Special Attacks tab UI elements were not responding to user interactions
- LimitSelection.js and AttackBasicsForm.js components had new `data-action` attributes
- Parent SpecialAttackTab.js event handlers used camelCase but HTML used kebab-case
- Missing handlers for modal management and form interactions

**Solution**: Complete event handler refactoring
- âœ… Fixed action name mismatch (camelCase â†’ kebab-case)
- âœ… Added comprehensive event handlers for all interactive elements
- âœ… Implemented proper state management pattern compliance
- âœ… Added user notifications for all actions (success/error feedback)
- âœ… Enhanced dropdown clearing after successful additions
- âœ… Added modal management methods (openLimitModal, closeLimitModal)

**Key Technical Insights**:
- Event delegation requires exact string matching between HTML attributes and handler keys
- Centralized event handling in parent components maintains component independence
- State management pattern: System class â†’ updateCharacter() â†’ showNotification()
- UI feedback is critical for user experience in complex forms

**Functional Elements Now Working**:
- Attack creation, selection, and deletion
- Attack type/effect type addition and removal
- Basic condition management
- Limit category expansion/collapse
- Limit addition and removal (both modal and table)
- Upgrade purchasing and removal
- All form inputs with real-time updates
