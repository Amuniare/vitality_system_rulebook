## Implementation Strategy

### Technical Approach
1. **Data-First Updates**: Start with JSON file updates to ensure content accuracy
2. **Calculator Verification**: Audit all calculation systems against rulebook formulas
3. **Component Testing**: Test each major component independently
4. **Integration Testing**: Verify system interactions work correctly
5. **User Testing**: Validate complete character creation workflows

### Risk Mitigation
- **Backup Current State**: Create branch with current working version
- **Incremental Updates**: Update one system at a time
- **Regression Testing**: Ensure existing functionality still works
- **User Communication**: Document any breaking changes clearly

### Quality Assurance
- **Rulebook Cross-Reference**: Each update verified against official rules
- **Point Calculation Audits**: Mathematical verification of all formulas
- **Character Build Testing**: Test with various archetype combinations
- **Export Validation**: Ensure exported characters work with automation

## Success Metrics

### Functional Metrics
- ‚úÖ All archetype point calculations match rulebook exactly
- ‚úÖ Character export format compatible with existing automation
- ‚úÖ No regression in existing character creation workflows
- ‚úÖ All new rulebook content properly implemented

### User Experience Metrics
- ‚úÖ Character creation time remains reasonable
- ‚úÖ Validation messages are clear and helpful
- ‚úÖ Complex builds can be created without confusion
- ‚úÖ Export process works smoothly for Roll20 integration

## Timeline Summary

**Total Estimated Time**: 7 weeks
- **Phase 1** (Critical): 2 weeks
- **Phase 2** (Content): 2 weeks
- **Phase 3** (Polish): 2 weeks
- **Phase 4** (Testing): 1 week

## Next Steps

1. **Create detailed tickets** for each roadmap item
2. **Set up development branch** for rulebook updates
3. **Begin Phase 1** with archetype system modernization
4. **Establish testing protocols** for validation
5. **Plan user communication** for any breaking changes

This roadmap ensures the web application stays true to the updated Vitality System rulebook while maintaining the sophisticated architecture and user experience that already exists.
